## Gangs
Currently gangs are just a private chat area for a group of up to 32 friends to communicate but there are future plans for more to come to this.

As Gang Leader, you will have 3 additional options, when visiting one of your gang members profiles:
 - [KICK] - you can kick the gang member from the gang;
 - [PERMISSIONS] - here you can:
   - Invite - it allows the gang member to invite other players to the gang;
   - KickÂ  - it allows the gang member to kick other gang members;
   - Manage - it allows the gang member to add or remove other gang members permissions.
 - [TRANSFER LEADERSHIP] - self-explanatory; you can set a gang member as a leader in case you don't want to be the leader anymore or want to leave the gang.

Also as the Leader, in the Gang chat, if you click on the numbers of players that's inside the gang, othere you will be able to [DELETE GANG].


## Friends
To access your personal friends list, click on the floating menu and choose the 'people' icon. 
You can add friends by going into a users profile, scrolling down and clicking 'Add to Friend List'. Similarly you can do the same to remove a friend by clicking the 'Remove From Friend List' button.
Adding someone on the friends list will not require for the other person to accept the friend request offer. They will be simply added to your friends list.
Viewing your friends list will allow you to see if they are online, idle or offline.
