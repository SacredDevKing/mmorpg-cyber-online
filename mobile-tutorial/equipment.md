## Equipment
You can equip gear that you own, as long as the gear level you wish to equip is not higher than your current player level. All equipment is divided into rarities:

  - Trash (grey)
  - Common (white)
  - High Quality (green)
  - Rare (yellow)
  - Legendary (purplish pink)
  - Epic (Red)

Higher rarities will give a higher quality item with better stats and more module upgrade slots. Higher level equipment will give better stats compared to lower level ones, so save up your Rare and Legendary Caches.

## Upgrade Modules

You can install upgrade modules on your equipment. To equip the upgrade modules, the module upgrade's level cannot be higher than the equipment's level. Upgrade modules can be removed any time.

### Cache
Caches can be used to print gear equivalent to your current printing level at the Molecular 3D Printer. The level of the printed gear will be the same as your printing level.

### Ammo
Ammo are used to fire special attacks and destructive attacks. Special attacks use Energy Cells while Destructive attacks use Antimatter Charges. Each fire will consume one ammo. You can own a maximum of 1000 Energy Cells and 1000 Antimatter Charges each in your pocket. You can craft ammo via the in-game crafting function or by defeating enemies.

### Medical
Medical items can be used to regenerate health in dungeons. There are two types of medical items, self-use and AOE. After using the item your health regenerates according to the amount described. Your health will not be healed beyond your maximum health capacity. Medical items can be either crafted via the in-game crafting function or by defeating enemies.

### Experience memories
Higher level Experience Memories yield more XP and can be used during fights. Experience Memories are mostly found in dungeons.

### Synaptic Acceleration Transmitter
The Synaptic Acceleration Transmitter is used to speed up AFK jobs. The item will give everyone a buff which will show on your profile under 'Global Effects'. Each transmitter will add +5% speed to tasks. Only tasks that are started when the buff is active will be buffed, tasks already running will not be affected. This item can be used multiple times to stack the effect up to +80%. The effect will last for 20 minutes, however the time will reset each time one is used.
