## Equipment
You can equip gear that you own as long as the gear level you wish to equip is not higher than your current player level. All equipment will be one of the following rarities:

  - Trash (grey)
  - Common (white)
  - High Quality (green)
  - Rare (yellow)
  - Legendary (purplish pink)
  - Epic (Red)

Higher rarities will give higher quality items with better stats and more module upgrade slots. Higher level equipment will give better stats compared to lower level ones, so save up your Rare+ caches.

## Finding Equipment

You can find equipment and equipment caches in the dungeons or when fighting individual enemies.

You are also able to use the Player Market once you are level 5 to purchase specific items.

## Printing Equipment

Caches can be used to print equipment at your current Printing Rank at the Molecular 3D Printer in the City Center. The level of the printed gear will be the same as your printing level, not your player level, so make sure you keep your printing rank caught up.

## Upgrade Modules

You can install upgrade modules on your equipment. To equip the upgrade modules, the module upgrade's level cannot be higher than the equipment's level. Upgrade modules can be removed at any time.
