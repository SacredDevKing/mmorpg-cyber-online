## Chat

There are 3 types of chat rooms in CyberCode Online currently: 
- Global (or General Chat) - Where everyone can chat freely and interact with each other.
- Gang - Only the members of your gang can chat and see the messages sent in that channel.
- Private Messages (Mail) - Where you can privately chat with people. You will receive notifications as in a form of Mail from the System after you sent items to someone or vice versa, or when someone bought your listings on the Player Market.

In order to mention (or tag) someone in the Global chat, you can use '@' and the name of the user. As you type their name, a list will appear and you can select the desired name from that list.

The player mentioned by you will receive a notification that you mentioned them. (Note: You can't mention someone in the private chat for obvious reasons)
