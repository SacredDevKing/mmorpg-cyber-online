## Chat

In Cyber Code Online, there's 3 types of chat: 
- Global (or General Chat) - where everyone can chat freely and interact with each other;
- Gang - where only the members of the gang can chat and see the messages sent in that channel;
- Private Message (Mail) - where you can privately chat with only one person that you want, at a time. You will also receive a notification as a Mail from the System when you are sending items to a person, someone is sending you items or when someone bought your items sold on the Player Market.

In order to mention (or tag) someone in the Global chat, you can use '@' and the name of the user.
As you type their name, a list will appear and you can select the desired name from that list.

The player mentioned by you, in case they're not inside the game, will receive a notification on their phone knowing that you wanted to talk to him/her.

The mention function does not work in the Private Message (Mail) chat because the person whom you're writing, will receive a notification about the messages every time when you are writing to him/her.
