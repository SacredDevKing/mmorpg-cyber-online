## Ammo

### Energy Cells  

Your Special Weapon uses Energy Cells. You can find Energy Cells as drops after winning fights or by crafting them using Ammunition Tech Parts.  

### Antimatter Charges 

Your Destructive Weapon uses Antimatter Charges. You can find them as drops (less often than Energy Cells) or by crafting them from Military Ammunition Tech Parts.  

## Tech Parts  
You can use tech parts (ammo and medical) to craft corresponding items via in the game crafting functions located in your Inventory menu.  

### Tech Scrap  
Carry out reverse engineering (uses one Tech Scrap per job) to gain printing experience after a short period of time.

## Medical  

Players can use Medical Tech Parts and Tech Scrap to craft medicine for use in dungeons. In order to craft better medicine, players need to improve their medical science levels which can be done by performing the associated job training or by crafting medicine. Furthermore, better medicine requires players to use more Medical Tech Parts. For example, the lowest level medicine that can be crafted is the Pain Away for 1 Medical Tech Part while the Degraded Nano Repair Bot needs 2 Medical Tech Parts and a medical science level of 10.  
  
There are two categories of medicine that can be crafted: single heals and group heals.

### Single Heals  

As the name suggests, single heals will only heal yourself for the specified amount. Single heal medicines are items such as Pain Away and anything ending with Bot (e.g. Nano Medic Bot). In order to craft single heals, you need the specified medical science level and Medical Tech Parts.  

### Group Heals  

Group heals can heal the entire group in a dungeon when used but will heal each person less than single heals of the same tier. Group heals are items such as Pain Away Spray and anything ending with Drone (e.g. Nano Medic Drone). In order to craft group heals, you need the same level single heal and the associated number of Tech Scrap. For instance, to make Pain Away Spray you need 1 Pain Away and 1 Tech Scrap.
