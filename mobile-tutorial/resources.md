## Ammo

### Energy Cells  

Your Special Weapon uses Energy Cells. You can find Energy Cells as drops after winning fights or by crafting them using Ammunition Tech Parts. You can carry a maximum of 2000 Energy Cells at a time.

### Antimatter Charges 

Your Destructive Weapon uses Antimatter Charges. You can find them as drops (less often than Energy Cells) or by crafting them from Military Ammunition Tech Parts. You can carry a maximum of 2000 Antimatter Charges at a time.

## Tech Parts  
You can use tech parts (ammo and medical) to craft corresponding items via in the game crafting functions located in your Inventory menu.  

### Tech Scrap  
Carry out reverse engineering (uses one Tech Scrap per job) to gain printing experience after a short period of time.

## Medical  

Players can use Medical Tech Parts and Tech Scrap to craft medicine for use in dungeons. In order to craft better medicine, players need to improve their medical science levels which can be done by performing the associated job training or by crafting medicine. Furthermore, better medicine requires players to use more Medical Tech Parts. For example, the lowest level medicine that can be crafted is the Pain Away for 1 Medical Tech Part while the Degraded Nano Repair Bot needs 2 Medical Tech Parts and a medical science level of 10.  
  
There are two categories of medicine that can be crafted: single heals and group heals.

### Single Heals  

As the name suggests, single heals will only heal yourself for the specified amount. Single heal medicines are items such as Pain Away and anything ending with Bot (e.g. Nano Medic Bot). In order to craft single heals, you need the specified medical science level and Medical Tech Parts.  

### Group Heals  

Group heals can heal the entire group in a dungeon when used but will heal each person less than single heals of the same tier. Group heals are items such as Pain Away Spray and anything ending with Drone (e.g. Nano Medic Drone). In order to craft group heals, you need the same level single heal and the associated number of Tech Scrap. For instance, to make Pain Away Spray you need 1 Pain Away and 1 Tech Scrap.  

## Boosts

### Synaptic Acceleration Transmitter

This item will boost how quickly AFK time passes by +5% for 10 minutes, stackable to +80%. You can use another to extend the duration of the boost, resetting the timer. To make use of the boost, you just need to begin an AFK session while the boost is active. This item is global and will affect and stack with other people. This does not stack with the rare version.

## Global Paid Items

These items can be purchased in the Arasaka Unit Exchange. The effects are global and will give everyone the benefits.

### Rare Synaptic Acceleration Transmitter

These are similar to regular Synaptic Acceleration Transmitters but don't stack with them. The rare version will instantly boost how quickly AFK time passes by +40% for 20 minutes, stackable to +80%. You can use another to extend the duration of the boost, resetting the timer. To make use of the boost, you just need to begin an AFK session while the boost is active. This item is global and will affect and stack with other people.

### Transaction Exploit Transmitter

The Transaction Exploit Transmitter is used to boost BitCoin gains and works the same way as the transmitters in that you can use multiple to stack the effect and prolong the timer. Each Transaction Exploit Transmitter will provide a +40% boost to BitCoin gain for 20 minutes. Stacking maxes out at 100%.

### Frontal Cortex Optimization Transmitter

The Frontal Cortex Optimization Transmitter is used to boost EXP gains. Each Frontal Cortex Optimization Transmitter will provide a +80% boost to EXP gain for 20 minutes.

### Global Time Skips

Although these aren't items, players can also purchase global skips from their AFK screen (the Map tab when an AFK task is in progress). Skippers can choose from a range of 15 minutes to 180 minutes to skip. The time skips work with boosts, so it's more cost-efficient to use skips when boosts are already running.

As with all other paid items, time skips apply to everyone on the server. However, since they skip time immediately, only players who have started AFK tasks before the button is pressed will receive the benefit. Often it can be helpful to coordinate in global chat so people are ready to tag along.

The benefit is also applied to all AFK players one-by-one, so it may take 1 ~ 3 minutes for the effects to apply for everyone. Most regular skippers will recommend waiting around 1 minute after the skip button becomes available again, and purchasing 30-minute skips is the most popular choice when boosts are also running.
