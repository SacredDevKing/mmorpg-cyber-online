## Dungeons


## Types
  
These are the two dungeons you are able to enter. The [normal] dungeon will include a key fragment in the treasure room and no boss. The [challenge] dungeon is a lot harder, but includes more crates for loot and has a boss in the treasure room.  
  
## Entrance & Icons
  
Here you can see the first room of a dungeon. The icon on the bottom middle is a way out of the dungeon and does the same thing as the 'Quit Dungeon' button. You can also see a door in the middle at the top which will take you to another room of the dungeon. You can find these doors on all sides of the dungeon.  

There are three alien looking icons in the middle of the dungeon, these are the bad guys. Simply click on one of them to start a fight. The other square icon near the middle of the dungeon is a crate, once all bad guys have been dispatched you are then able to loot the crates in the dungeon.  

## Co-op

As you can see here we have two players in the same dungeon. The rules are the same as single player except someone else is able to help you out. When using heals, it is usually advised to use the multi user heals as you will then health both yourself and your co-op partner. You can see everyone's health bars above the player icons.  

## Fighting

Rules are slightly different in the dungeon to when you fight the individual bad guys. As you will have a new button at the bottom labeled 'Use Item'. After each fight your health will no longer regenerate, so it's a good idea to craft lots of health items before entering. To then use these health items, during the fight, click 'Use Item' and then select your prefered medical item.  

You also have an 'Escape' button, the chance of you escaping here is based off your player 'escape' stat and is not definite like when fighting an individual bad guy.  

## Loot & Used Icons

Here is an example of a room that has been completed, note the greyed out crates, signifying that they have been used. Also see the door on the left wall is also greyed out, meaning you have already been though it. This is a good way to not get lost when exploring the dungeons.  

## Treasure / Boss Room and Good Guy

This room is special, you can tell this because of the increased number of crates. To note, one of these crates if in a normal dungeon will include a key. If in a challenge dungeon, one of the enemies will be a boss.  

Something else that's different in this image is the '?'. This represents the good guy, they can give you special quests that usually include a trade of some sort. You can find one good guy per dungeon and he's usually placed randomly in one of the rooms.
