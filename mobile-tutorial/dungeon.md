## Dungeons


### Types
  
![DungeonTypes](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonTypes.png)
  
These are the two dungeons you are able to enter. The [normal] dungeon will include a key fragment in the treasure room and no boss. The [challenge] dungeon is a lot harder, but includes more crates for loot and has a boss in the treasure room.  
  
### Entrance & Used Icons
  
![DungeonEntranceUsed](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonEntranceUsed.png)
  
Here you can see the first room of a dungeon. The icon on the bottom middle is a way out of the dungeon and does the same thing as the 'Quit Dungeon' button. You can also see a door in the middle at the top which will take you to another room of the dungeon. You can find these doors on all sides of the dungeon.  

This is also an example of a room that has been completed, note the greyed out crates, signifying that they have been used. Also see the door on the right wall is also greyed out, meaning you have already been through it. This is a good way to not get lost when exploring the dungeons. 

### Enemies
  
![DungeonEnemies](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonEnemies.png)
  
There are four alien looking icons in the middle of the dungeon, these are the bad guys. Simply click on one of them to start a fight. The other square icons are a crate, once all bad guys have been dispatched you are then able to loot the crates in the dungeon and move to the next room.  

### Fighting
  
![DungeonFight](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonFight.png)
  
Rules are slightly different in the dungeon to when you fight the individual bad guys. As you will have a new row of buttons above your attacks, you can assign usable items to these from your inventory. A good item to always have assigned is a healing item. After each fight your health will no longer regenerate, which is where these healing items come in.

You also have an 'Escape' button, which is located in the top left. The chance of you escaping here is based off your player 'escape' stat and is not definite like when fighting an individual bad guy.  
 
### Good Guy (?)
  
![DungeonGoodguy](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonGoodguy.png)
  
Something else that's different in this image is the '?'. This represents the good guy, they can give you special quests that usually include a trade of some sort. You can find one good guy per dungeon and they are usually placed randomly in one of the rooms.  
  
![DungeonGoodguy2](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonGoodguy2.png)
  
Here is an example of the dialogue that pops up after clicking on the '?'. They will usually ask for one item in return for another item or power up. It is up to you to decide if the trade is worthwhile, however if you can afford it, it is always worth taking for the xp it provides. Some of the text on this screen is randomly generated from a file, so you may get odd references or funny dialogues.

### Treasure / Boss Room
  
![DungeonBossTreasureCoop](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonBossTreasureCoop.png)
  
This room is special, you can tell this because of the increased number of crates. To note, one of these crates if in a normal dungeon will include a key. If in a challenge dungeon, one of the enemies will be a boss.  

In this screenshot you can also see other players helping out, this is especially advised at low levels and when attempting a challenge dungeon.

### Co-op
  
![DungeonCoop](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonCoop.png)
![DungeonCoop2](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonCoop2.png)
  
As you can see here we have a number of players in the same dungeon. The rules are the same as single player except other people are able to help you out. When using heals, it is usually advised to use the multi user heals as you will then heal both yourself and your co-op partners. You can see everyone's health bars above the player icons.  

In the second image, at the bottom under the 'quit dungeon' button you will find a button called 'Send invite to global chat'. This will do as it states and list your dungeon and its level in global chat so others can join easily.

![DungeonCoop3](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonCoop3.png)
  
When creating a dungeon you may have noticed you get to name it and choose if its public or not, this is for these screens. In the first image you can see I have pressed the floating button in the bottom right, this is where you can view the list of currently open dungeons. Clicking on it will open the second image. In the top right you can find the dungeon level and in the middle you can see a list of players and their status. At the bottom it shows how many enemies are left, if you wish you can join a nearly empty dungeon to claim all the loot or look for a new one for the xp.
