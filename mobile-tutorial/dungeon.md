## Dungeons


### Types
  
![DungeonTypes](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonTypes.png)
  
These are the two types of dungeons that you are able to enter. The [normal] dungeon will include a key fragment in the treasure room and no boss. The [challenge] dungeon is a lot harder, but includes more crates for loot and has a boss in the treasure room.  
  
### Entrance & Used Icons
  
![DungeonEntranceUsed](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonEntranceUsed.png)
  
Here you can see the first room of a dungeon. The icon on the bottom middle is a way out of the dungeon and does the same thing as the 'Quit Dungeon' button. You can also see a door at the top which will take you to another room in the dungeon. You can find these doors on all sides of the dungeon rooms.  

This is also an example of a room that has been completed, note the greyed out crates, indicating that they have been explored before. The door on the right wall is also greyed out, which means you have already been through it. This is essential to not get lost while exploring the dungeon. 

### Enemies
  
![DungeonEnemies](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonEnemies.png)
  
There are four alien looking icons spreaded across and rooms, and these are the enemies you have to defeat before being to proceed to the next room or to explore the crates in the room. Simply click on one of them to fight them.

### Fighting
  
![DungeonFight](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonFight.png)
  
Rules are slightly different in the dungeons when you fight enemies. You will have a new row of 3 buttons above your attack options, which you can assign usable items to these from your inventory. You should assign medical items to your "hotbar" since your health doesn't regenerate automatically after each fight.

You also have an 'Escape' button on the top left. The success rate of you escaping is based on your player `escape` stat.  
 
### Good Guy (?)
  
![DungeonGoodguy](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonGoodguy.png)
  
Something else that's different in this image is the '?'. This represents the good guy, they can give you special quests that usually include a trade of some sort. You can find one good guy per dungeon and they are usually placed randomly in one of the rooms.  
  
![DungeonGoodguy2](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonGoodguy2.png)
  
Here is an example of the dialogue that pops up after clicking on the '?'. They will usually ask for one item in return for another item or power up. It is up to you to decide if the trade is worthwhile, however if you can afford it, it is always worth taking for the xp it provides. Some of the text on this screen is randomly generated from a file, so you may get odd references or funny dialogues.

### Lore (!)

There are exclamation marks dotted around dungeons, these are snippets of lore.

### Treasure / Boss Room
  
![DungeonBossTreasureCoop](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonBossTreasureCoop.png)
  
This room is special, you can tell this because of the increased number of crates. The crate which looks like a window contains a key.

In this screenshot you can also see other players helping out, this is especially advised at low levels and when attempting a challenge dungeon.

### Co-op
  
![DungeonCoop](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonCoop.png)
![DungeonCoop2](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonCoop2.png)
  
As you can see here we have a number of players in the same dungeon. The rules are the same as a single player except other people are able to help you out. When using heals, it is usually advised to use the AOE user heals (such as Pain Away Spray) to heal both yourself and your co-op partners. You can see everyone's health bars above the player icons.  

In the second image, at the bottom under the '[QUIT DUNGEON]' button you will find a button called '[Send invite to global chat]'. This will send an invite to the global chat so others can join easily. Anyone around your level can join and help you out (Please note: In order to join another player's Co-op dungeon, the player's level needs to be at least 10 levels below or at most 12 levels above than the dungeon level). You can also click the dungeon link in chat to join other peoples dungeons.  
  
![DungeonCoop4](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonCoop4.png)
![DungeonCoop3](/resources/mobile-tutorial/DungeonCoop3.png)
  
When creating a dungeon you may have noticed you can name it and choose to make it Public or Private, only for you to solo it. You can also protect the dungeon with a password to prevent random people from joining your dungeon.

In the first image you can press floating button in the bottom right to view the list of currently open dungeons. Clicking on it will open the second image. In the top right you can find the dungeon level and in the middle you can see a list of players and their status. At the bottom it shows how many enemies are left, if you wish you can join a nearly empty dungeon to claim all the loot or look for a new one for the xp.
 
When an enemy is killed with the help from a friend, everyone who dealt 20% damage or more is given xp and a chance for a reward. All crates are unique to each player so you don't need to worry about people stealing your loot.

When you die in a dungeon you cannot rejoin the dungeon.
