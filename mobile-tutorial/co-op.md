## Dungeon Co-op

Dungeons can be found in the 'Adventure' area underneath the list of enemies. When in a dungeon you can click 'Send invite to global chat' and a message will appear in chat. Anyone around your level can then join you and help out. You can also click the link in chat that appears to join other peoples dungeons. When an enemy is killed with help from a friend, everyone who dealt 20% damage or more is given xp and a chance of a reward. All crates are unique to each player. In order to join another player's Co-op dungeon, the player's level cannot be 12 levels higher than the dungeon and 9 levels lower than the dungeon. 

## Gangs
Currently gangs are just a private area for a group of up to 10 friends to communicate but there are future plans for more to come of this.

## Friends
To access your personal friends list, click on the floating menu and choose the 'friends' icon. You can add friends by going into a users profile, scrolling down and clicking 'Add to Friend List'. Similarly you can do the same to remove a friend by clicking the 'Remove From Friend List' button. Viewing the list of your friends will allow you to see if they are online, idle or offline.
