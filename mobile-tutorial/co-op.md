## Dungeon Co-op

Dungeons can be found in the 'Adventure' area underneath the list of enemies. When in a dungeon you can click 'Send invite to global chat' and a message will appear in chat. Anyone around your level can then join you and help out. You can also click the link in chat that appears to join other peoples dungeons. When an enemy is killed with the help from a friend, everyone who dealt 20% damage or more is given xp and a chance at a reward. All crates are unique to each player. In order to join another player's Co-op dungeon, the player's level cannot be 12 levels higher than the dungeon and 9 levels lower than the dungeon.

When you die in a dungeon, regular enemy or boss, you cannot rejoin your dungeon.

When starting a dungeon, you can leave it as Public (if you swipe it, the dungeon will become private) and you can set a
 Password, so only your friends or gang members can join based on the password that you will provide.

All public dungeons can be seen and joined if you access the floating menu (the 3 horizontal lines menu) anywhere from the game, besides the General Chat and click on the 2 buildings symbol.

## Gangs
Currently gangs are just a private area for a group of up to 16 friends to communicate but there are future plans for more to come of this.

As Gang Leader, you will have 3 additional options, when visiting one of your gang members profiles:
* [KICK] - you can kick the gang member from the gang;
* [PERMISSIONS] - here you can:
  * Invite - it allows the gang member to invite other players to the gang;
  * KickÂ  - it allows the gang member to kick other gang members;
  * Manage - it allows the gang member to add or remove other gang members permissions.
* [TRANSFER LEADERSHIP] - self explanatory; you can set a gang member as a leader in case you don't want to be the leader anymore or want to leave the gang.

Also as the Leader, in the Gang chat, if you click on the numbers of players that's inside the gang, othere you will be able to [DELETE GANG].


## Friends
To access your personal friends list, click on the floating menu and choose the 'people' icon. You can add friends by going into a users profile, scrolling down and clicking 'Add to Friend List'. Similarly you can do the same to remove a friend by clicking the 'Remove From Friend List' button. Viewing your friends list will allow you to see if they are online, idle or offline.
