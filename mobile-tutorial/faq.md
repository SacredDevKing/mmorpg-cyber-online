### What is this game, and what do I do?
Basically you adventure around 'Train Stations' and either defeat individual enemies or conquer entire dungeons.
You'll randomly receive items, equipment or caches after defeating enemies.

**You will receive BTC and EXP inside a battle, but items won't drop after every single battle.**

### Is this game P2W (Pay-to-Win)?
No. There's no element in this game that would benefit or offer additional advantages to some players over others.

The Transmitters sold in the Arasaka Unit Exchange have a global effect, which means once it is activated, all players on the server will benefit from the effect that it gives. Similarly, the Global Skips that can be purchased apply to all players who have started AFK tasks.

The developer intends to keep the game non-P2W into the future.

### Why is the equipment I print the wrong level?
Your printed gear will have the same level as the one from your 'Printing Rank'. It does not scale with player level.

### How do I increase my printing rank?
There are 3 ways to increase your printing rank.

1. Print caches at the 3D Printing Module. Each cache you print gives you printing exp. Trash caches are the cheapest to print and the printed gear can be scrapped for Tech Scrap.

2. AFK Printing Training. There is an AFK job in the Commercial Area called 'Work in Printing Factory' that gives you printing exp.

3. Reverse engineering Tech Scraps. In the Commercial Area there is a short AFK job called 'Reverse Engineer Scraps' which uses Tech Scraps to increase your printing rank. This is the fastest way to increase your rank. 

### What are caches and what should I do with them?
You can use them to craft equipment at the Molecular 3D Printer.  It is not recommended to scrap your caches because they are more valuable to print or sell.

### Do caches scale with my level? Should I keep them for later?
The caches you print scale with your Printing Rank.
The gear that you obtain from them will always have the same level as your Printing Rank. Make sure to level your Printing Rank to your current player level to always receive the best equipment possible from printing.

It doesn't matter if you print your caches now or later, but it's recommended to keep your Legendary caches for levels 30-40+.  If you happen to find an Epic cache, hold onto it until level 100+.
Legendary and Epic caches are much more expensive to craft than Rare ones, but the items have much better stats.  Higher quality items can last you for a long time, and are often worth calibrating at the Calibration Station.

### Will higher level enemies give more rewards?
Yes. Higher level enemies give you more BTC and experience after you defeat them.

### What are Locked Containers and how do I unlock them?
Locked containers (✧) can be found and picked up from dungeons. They can be unlocked using Tech Scraps at the Terminal in the main HUB, and contain various rewards ranging from Tech Scrap to Legendary gear.

Tech scrap costs for opening the containers are 32 Tech Scrap for common containers, 64 for rare containers, and 128 for legendary ones.

If you don't see the option for unlocking the container at the Terminal, it means you do not have enough Tech Scraps.
