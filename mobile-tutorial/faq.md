### What is this game, what do I do?
To begin, travel to the 'Hyper Train Central Station' then start in the lvl 1 area and beat up some bad guys. You will slowly accumulate weapons, armour (in form of printable caches) and levels to take on the dungeons and harder areas.

### Is this game P2W (Pay-to-Win)?
No. There's no element in this game that would benefit or offer additional advantages to some players over the others.

Even the Transmitters sold in the Arasaka Unit Exchange have a global effect, meaning that once activated all players from the server will benefit the effect that they have.

The developer intend to keep the game non-P2W in the future.

You can create one if you go to Chat, then Gang tab and pay 100,000 BTC. 
Other than a separate chat from the global chat, guilds don't have any other functions.

It's forbidden to have the same tag as other gangs. All gangs should have different tags in order to avoid confusion.

You can't gift key fragments to anyone. Not even sell them. 

### Does this game have PvP?
No. PvP is not currently available in the game.

### What are caches and what should I do with them?
Caches are like lootboxes, except you don't pay for them. They contain random weapons and armor.
You can use them to craft your equipment.

### Does caches scale with my level? Should I keep them for later?
The caches you get scale only to your Printing Rank.
It doesn't matter if you print your caches now or later.
The gear that you will obtain from them, whether it is weapon or armor, it will always have the same exact level as your Printing Rank.

The only caches that are recommended to keep for later levels (lvl 30 - 40+) are the legendary ones and of course, epic ones, if it ever happens to get one as a drop.
Legendary caches are much more expensive to craft than Rare ones, have much better stats than Rare and it will last longer, meaning that you don't have to switch them out for another piece of gear until you are 9 or 10 levels above the level of the legendary gear that you are wearing.

### What is BitCoin (BTC) and how do I redeem it?
BitCoin (BTC) is just the game's currency, so the Bitcoin here isn't the same as the one from the real world.

However, if you want to support the game, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cybercodeonline) or buy a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cybercodeonline) monthly subscription.

### How do I get more Bitcoins?
You can get more by mining 'Hash Processors' (that drops from dungeons) at the [Job Hub].
You can also get Bitcoins by selling caches, gear, crafting itmes and other types of items in the Player Market.

### What are Transmitters?
They are special items that can be bought only with Units (premium currency).
The only exception is with the normal afk transmitter that drops from dungeons and can reduce the afk time only to 5%.
They have a global effect meaning that once activated all players on the server benefits their effects.
Their effects can range from reducing the time on an afk job or activity to increased BTC gain.

### Where is the Player Market?

### How do I repair my equipment?
You can repair your equipment by paying a small amount of BTC at the Weaponsmith which you can find in the City Centre.

### Can I upgrade or level up my weapons and armours?
You can't modify the rarity (e.g. from Rare to transform in Legendary) of a weapon or armour, nor you can level it up your old weapons or armours to your current level.
You can however print new weapons and armours or buy them off from Player Market.

### Can I remove installed upgrade modules?
Yes. Just click on the installed upgrade module to remove it from the equipment.

### What "Quality" on weapons and armor means?
High Quality (e. g. 96) on an weapon or armor means that weapon or armor will have excellent stats.
Low quality means that stats on the equipment will perform poorly.
You can't change the Quality of an weapon or armor.

### Why is the equipment I print the wrong level?
Your printed gear will have the same level as the one from your 'Printing Rank'. It does not scale with player level.

### How do I increase my printing rank?
There are 3 ways to increase your printing rank.  

1. Print caches. Each cache you print increases your rank. So the best possible way to increase your rank with this is to print all your trash caches, as they cost less to print.  

2. AFK Printing Training . In the Commercial Area there is an afk job called 'Work in Printing Factory' that increases your printing rank. 

3. Reverse engineer Tech Scraps. In the Commercial Area there is an afk job called 'Reverse Engineer Scraps' which uses Tech Scraps to increase your printing rank. This is by far the fastest way to increase your rank and you can combine it with No. 1 (print caches, select the gear (you can select multiple items at once) and then scrap them for Tech Scraps)

### What will happen if I die?
You will lose some of your experience and BTC (around 10%), however your inventory will be safe and you won't lose any items.

### Will higher level enemies give more rewards?
Yes. Higher level enemies give you more BTC and experience after you defeat them.

### What should I do if my inventory is full?
You can either scrap, destroy or store them in the bank located in the City Centre. Beware that the fee for each item you deposit in the bank is 100 BTC. 

You can also temporarily increase the inventory capacity with the 'pocket' stat found on equipment.

### How do I craft items?
On the Inventory page at the top you will find a tab called 'Crafting'.

### Where can I get healing items?
Healing items can either be crafted, found when defeating an enemy or when looting a crate in a dungeon.

### What are Public and Private Dungeons? What are Password Protected Dungeons?
A dungeon is Public by default when you create one. Public Dungeons are available to everyone to see and join, of course under certain level conditions.
When you create a dungeon you can swipe the button to make your dungeon private. That means that it's not visible to other players and only you can play in the dungeon.

Instead of making your dungeon private, you can choose instead to protect it with a password by swiping the 'Dungeon password' button to active and type a password.

Password protected dungeons can be seen by other players but they cannot join unless they know what the password is.
This option allows you to invite only certain players to your dungeon.
Once you set a password for your dungeon you can't change it. So please write it down somewhere so you don't forget it.

Most dungeons in this game that are opened by other players are  generally public.

### What is "Performance score"?
Performance score is a (developer) stat that allows to see how well your device can handle the game.
A performance score that's under 2000 means that your device can handle the game pretty well.
A performance score that's between 2000 - 4000 means that your device handles the game pretty poorly and it will heat up, it means that your game can lag and battery will drain faster.
