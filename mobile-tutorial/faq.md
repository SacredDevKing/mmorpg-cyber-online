### Why is the equipment I print the wrong level?
Your printed gear will take its level from your 'printing rank' not your player level.

### How do I increase my printing rank?
There are 3 ways to increase your printing rank.  

1. Print caches. Each cache you print increases your rank. So the best possible way to increase your rank with this is to print all your trash caches, as they cost less to print.  

2. AFK Printing Training . In the Commercial Area there is an afk job that increases your printing rank.  

3. Reverse engineer equipment scraps. In the Commercial Area there is an afk job called Reverse Engineer Scraps which uses tech scraps to increase your printing rank. This is by far the fastest way to increase your rank , and you can combine it with No. 1 (print caches and then scrap them for tech scraps)

### How do I increase my Scavenge Skill?
In every area with enemies there is an action called AFK Resource Gather, near the bottom of the list.

### What is the Gear Score?
Gear Score is the average level of your equipment you wear. This doesn't take into account anything but the equipment level.

### What is the pocket Stat?
Pockets increase your inventory size. 1 pocket means 1 extra additional space.

### What is the bargain Stat?
Bargain gives you better deals in the Weapon Smith and the Trinoky Mart, which can be found in the Central Hub.You can sell your items for better prices and buy items cheaper.
