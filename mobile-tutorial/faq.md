### What is this game, what do I do?
To begin, travel to the 'Hyper Train Central Station' then start in the lvl 1 area and beat up some bad guys. You will slowly accumulate weapons, armour (in form of printable caches) and levels to take on the dungeons and harder areas.

### Is this game P2W (Pay-to-Win)?
No. There's no element in this game that would benefit or offer additional advantages to some players over the others.

Even the Transmitters sold in the Arasaka Unit Exchange have a global effect, meaning that once activated all players from the server will benefit the effect that they have.

The developer intend to keep the game non-P2W in the future.

### Is there any customization in the game?
You can have a custom profile picture in your profile, a Title and a coloured chat border if you decide to subscribe to one of the 3 Donation Tiers available.

### Can I change my name?
No, currently you can't do that. You are stuck with your username.

### Can I search the usernames of other people?
No, you can't search for other people. Currently there's no way to do that.

### What are Gangs and how do I create one?
Gangs here are the equivalent of clans or guilds in other MMORPGs.
You can create one if you go to Chat, then Gang tab and pay 100,000 BTC. 
Other than a separate chat from the global chat, guilds don't have any other functions.
Gangs also allow you to have a tag of 3 letters that you chose when you created the gang, in your chat border.

### How do I search for a Gang? How do I join one?
Currently, you can't see a current list of gangs in the game.
You can join one if you create one yourself or if you get invited by the gang leader or if gang leader allowed the members of the gang to invite others inside.

### Does the game support trading among players?
Yes, partially. You can gift items to other players but there isn't a system that forces the other person to give something in exchange.
You can't currently gift BTC to someone. Only items.
You can't gift key fragments to anyone. Not even sell them. 

### Does this game have PvP?
No. PvP is not currently available in the game.

### What are caches and what should I do with them?
Caches are like lootboxes, except you don't pay for them. They contain random weapons and armor.
You can use them to craft your equipment.

# What is BitCoin (BTC) and how do I redeem it?
BitCoin (BTC) is just the game's currency, so the Bitcoin here isn't the same as the one from the real world.

However, if you want to support the game, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cybercodeonline) or buy a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cybercodeonline) monthly subscription.

### How do I get more Bitcoins?
You can get more by mining 'Hash Processors' (that drops from dungeons) at the [Job Hub].
You can also get Bitcoins by selling caches, gear, crafting itmes and other types of items in the Player Market.

### What are Transmitters?
They are special items that can be bought only with Units (premium currency).
The only exception is with the normal afk transmitter that drops from dungeons and can reduce the afk time only to 5%.
They have a global effect meaning that once activated all players on the server benefits their effects.
Their effects can range from reducing the time on an afk job or activity to increased BTC gain.

### Where is the Player Market?
When your character reaches level 5 the player market will be unlocked. It will show up in the 'Central Hub'. 

### How do I repair my equipment?
You can repair your equipment by paying a small amount of BTC at the Weaponsmith which you can find in the City Centre.

### Can I remove installed upgrade modules?
Yes. Just click on the installed upgrade module to remove it from the equipment.

### Why is the equipment I print the wrong level?
Your printed gear will have the same level as the one from your 'Printing Rank'. It does not scale with player level.

### Does caches scale with my level? Should I keep them for later?
As it was already explained in the previous question, the caches you get scale only to your Printing Rank.
It doesn't matter if you print your caches now or later.
The gear that you will obtain from them, whether it is weapon or armor, it will always have the same exact level as your Printing Rank.

The only caches that are recommended to keep for later levels (lvl 30 - 40+) are the legendary ones and of course, epic ones, if it ever happens to get one as a drop.
Legendary caches are much more expensive to craft than Rare ones, have much better stats than Rare and it will last longer, meaning that you don't have to switch them out for another piece of gear until you are 9 or 10 levels above the level of the legendary gear that you are wearing.

### How do I increase my printing rank?
There are 3 ways to increase your printing rank.  

1. Print caches. Each cache you print increases your rank. So the best possible way to increase your rank with this is to print all your trash caches, as they cost less to print.  

2. AFK Printing Training . In the Commercial Area there is an afk job called 'Work in Printing Factory' that increases your printing rank. 

3. Reverse engineer Tech Scraps. In the Commercial Area there is an afk job called 'Reverse Engineer Scraps' which uses Tech Scraps to increase your printing rank. This is by far the fastest way to increase your rank and you can combine it with No. 1 (print caches, select the gear (you can select multiple items at once) and then scrap them for Tech Scraps)

### What will happen if I die?
You will lose some of your experience and BTC (around 10%), however your inventory will be safe and you won't lose any items.

### Will higher level enemies give more rewards?
Yes. Higher level enemies give you more BTC and experience after you defeat them.

### What should I do if my inventory is full?
You can either scrap, destroy or store them in the bank located in the City Centre. Beware that the fee for each item you deposit in the bank is 100 BTC. 

You can also temporarily increase the inventory capacity with the 'pocket' stat found on equipment.

### How do I craft items?
On the Inventory page at the top you will find a tab called 'Crafting'.

### Where can I get healing items?
Healing items can either be crafted, found when defeating an enemy or when looting a crate in a dungeon.
They can also be purchased from the Player Market.

### What are Ai Cores?
Ai Cores are advanced pieces of technology that are inserted into robots allowing them to gather XP and items which will be automatically transferred to your account once the process is complete.
Basically they allow you to AFK for XP, items and a small amount of BTC.

### What are Hash Processors?
Hash Processors ('hash' for short) are processors that when inserted into a quantum computer, will mine for BTC (bitcoin). 
They drop from normal and challenge dungeons.

### How do I increase my Scavenge Skill?
In every area with enemies there is an action called AFK Resource Gather, near the bottom of the list.
It's located under the mobs list and under dungeons.
To be able to actually scavenge, you need to start from the lowest level (level 1 - 4) up to the top.

### What's Mining and how do I increase my mining skill?
Mining is the skill that allows you to get BTC (bitcoin) in the game.
It also allows you to craft level 10 and level 20 Ai Cores.
To mine you need to have Hash Processors which drops from dungeons.
If you want to start mining, simply go to the [Job Hub] and scroll down until you see the option to mine.

### What is the Gear Score?
Gear Score is the average level of your equipment you wear. This doesn't take into account anything but the equipment level.

### What is the Pocket Stat?
Pockets increase your inventory size. 1 pocket means 1 extra additional space.

### What is the Bargain Stat?
Bargain gives you better deals in the Weapon Smith and the Trinoky Mart, which can be found in the Central Hub.You can sell your items for better prices and buy items cheaper.

### What are Public and Private Dungeons? What are Password Protected Dungeons?
A dungeon is Public by default when you create one. Public Dungeons are available to everyone to see and join, of course under certain level conditions.
When you create a dungeon you can swipe the button to make your dungeon private. That means that it's not visible to other players and only you can play in the dungeon.

Instead of making your dungeon private, you can choose instead to protect it with a password by swiping the 'Dungeon password' button to active and type a password.

Password protected dungeons can be seen by other players but they cannot join unless they know what the password is.
This option allows you to invite only certain players to your dungeon.
Once you set a password for your dungeon you can't change it. So please write it down somewhere so you don't forget it.

Most dungeons in this game that are opened by other players are  generally public.
