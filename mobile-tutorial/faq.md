### What is this game, what do I do?
To begin with travel to the 'Hyper Train Central Station' then start in the lvl 1 area and beat up some bad guys. You will slowly accumulate weapons, armour and levels to take on the dungeons and harder areas.

### Where is the player market?
When your character reaches level 5 the player market will be unlocked. It will show up in the 'Central Hub'. 

### How to repair my equipment?
You can repair your equipment by paying a small amount of BTC at the Weaponsmith which you can find in the City Centre.

### Can I remove installed upgrade modules?
Click on the installed upgrade module to remove it from the equipment.

### Why is the equipment I print the wrong level?
Your printed gear will take its level from your 'printing rank' not your player level.

### What will happen if I die?
You will lose some of your experience and BTC, however your inventory will be safe.

### Will higher level enemies give more rewards?
Yes. Higher level enemies give you more BTC and experience after you defeat them.

### What should I do if my inventory is full?
You can either scrap, destroy or store them in the bank located in the City Centre. You can increase the number of items you can carry with the 'pocket' stat found on equipment.

### How do I craft items?
On the inventory page at the top you will find a tab called 'crafting'.

### Where can I get heals?
Heals can either be crafted, found when defeating an enemy or when looting a crate in a dungeon.

### How do I increase my printing rank?
There are 3 ways to increase your printing rank.  

1. Print caches. Each cache you print increases your rank. So the best possible way to increase your rank with this is to print all your trash caches, as they cost less to print.  

2. AFK Printing Training . In the Commercial Area there is an afk job that increases your printing rank.  

3. Reverse engineer equipment scraps. In the Commercial Area there is an afk job called Reverse Engineer Scraps which uses tech scraps to increase your printing rank. This is by far the fastest way to increase your rank , and you can combine it with No. 1 (print caches and then scrap them for tech scraps)

### How do I increase my Scavenge Skill?
In every area with enemies there is an action called AFK Resource Gather, near the bottom of the list.

### What is the Gear Score?
Gear Score is the average level of your equipment you wear. This doesn't take into account anything but the equipment level.

### What is the pocket Stat?
Pockets increase your inventory size. 1 pocket means 1 extra additional space.

### What is the bargain Stat?
Bargain gives you better deals in the Weapon Smith and the Trinoky Mart, which can be found in the Central Hub.You can sell your items for better prices and buy items cheaper.
