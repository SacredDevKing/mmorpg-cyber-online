### What is this game, what do I do?
To begin, travel to the 'Hyper Train Central Station' then start in the lvl 1 area and beat up some bad guys. You will slowly accumulate weapons, armour (in form of printable caches) and levels to take on the dungeons and harder areas.

### Is this game P2W (Pay-to-Win)?
No. There's no element in this game that would benefit or offer additional advantages to some players over the others.

Even the Transmitters sold in the Arasaka Unit Exchange have a global effect, meaning that once activated all players from the server will benefit the effect that they have.

The developer intend to keep the game non-P2W in the future.

### Is there any customization in the game?
You can have a custom profile picture in your profile, a Title and a coloured chat border if you decide to subscribe to one of the 3 Donation Tiers available.

### How do I redeem my BitCoins?
BitCoin is just the game's currency, so the Bitcoin (BTC) here isn't the same as the one from the real world.

However, if you want to support the game, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cybercodeonline) or buy a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cybercodeonline) monthly subscription.

### How do I get more Bitcoins?
You can get more by mining 'Hash Processors' (that drops from dungeons) at the [Job Hub].
You can also get Bitcoins by selling caches, gear, crafting itmes and other types of items in the Player Market.

### Where is the Player Market?
When your character reaches level 5 the player market will be unlocked. It will show up in the 'Central Hub'. 

### How do I repair my equipment?
You can repair your equipment by paying a small amount of BTC at the Weaponsmith which you can find in the City Centre.

### Can I remove installed upgrade modules?
Yes. Just click on the installed upgrade module to remove it from the equipment.

### Why is the equipment I print the wrong level?
Your printed gear will take its level from your 'Printing Rank' not your player level.

### How do I increase my printing rank?
There are 3 ways to increase your printing rank.  

1. Print caches. Each cache you print increases your rank. So the best possible way to increase your rank with this is to print all your trash caches, as they cost less to print.  

2. AFK Printing Training . In the Commercial Area there is an afk job called 'Work in Printing Factory' that increases your printing rank. 

3. Reverse engineer Tech Scraps. In the Commercial Area there is an afk job called 'Reverse Engineer Scraps' which uses Tech Scraps to increase your printing rank. This is by far the fastest way to increase your rank and you can combine it with No. 1 (print caches, select the gear (you can select multiple items at once) and then scrap them for Tech Scraps)

### What will happen if I die?
You will lose some of your experience and BTC (around 10%), however your inventory will be safe and you won't lose any items.

### Will higher level enemies give more rewards?
Yes. Higher level enemies give you more BTC and experience after you defeat them.

### What should I do if my inventory is full?
You can either scrap, destroy or store them in the bank located in the City Centre. Beware that the fee for each item you deposit in the bank is 100 BTC. 

You can also temporarily increase the inventory capacity with the 'pocket' stat found on equipment.

### How do I craft items?
On the inventory page at the top you will find a tab called 'Crafting'.

### Where can I get healing items?
Heals can either be crafted, found when defeating an enemy or when looting a crate in a dungeon.
They can also be purchased from the Player Market.

### How do I increase my Scavenge Skill?
In every area with enemies there is an action called AFK Resource Gather, near the bottom of the list.

### What is the Gear Score?
Gear Score is the average level of your equipment you wear. This doesn't take into account anything but the equipment level.

### What is the Pocket Stat?
Pockets increase your inventory size. 1 pocket means 1 extra additional space.

### What is the Bargain Stat?
Bargain gives you better deals in the Weapon Smith and the Trinoky Mart, which can be found in the Central Hub.You can sell your items for better prices and buy items cheaper.
