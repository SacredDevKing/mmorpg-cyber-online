### What is this game, what do I do?
Basically you adventure around these 'Train Stations' and either defeating individual enemies or entire dungeons. You'll randomly receive items, equipment or caches after defeating enemies. **It is compulsory to receive BTC and EXP after each battle, but items/equipment/caches don't drop after every single battle.**

### Is this game P2W (Pay-to-Win)?
No. There's no element in this game that would benefit or offer additional advantages to some players over the others.

Even the Transmitters sold in the Arasaka Unit Exchange have a global effect, which means once its activated all players one the server will benefit from the effect that it gives.

The developer intends to keep the game non-P2W in the future.

Your printed gear will have the same level as the one from your 'Printing Rank'. It does not scale with player level.

### How do I increase my printing rank?
There are 3 ways to increase your printing rank.  

1. Print caches. Each cache you print increases your rank. So the best possible way to increase your rank with this is to print all your trash caches, as they cost less to print.  

2. AFK Printing Training. There is an AFK job in the Commercial Area called 'Work in Printing Factory' that increases your printing rank. 

3. Reverse engineering Tech Scraps. In the Commercial Area there is a short AFK job called 'Reverse Engineer Scraps' which uses Tech Scraps to increase your printing rank. This is by far the fastest way to increase your rank and you can combine it with No. 1 (print caches, select the gear (you can select multiple items at once and then scrap them for Tech Scraps)
