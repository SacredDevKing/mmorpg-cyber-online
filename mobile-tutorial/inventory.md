## Inventory

You can access your inventory by clicking the option at the bottom menu bar. In your inventory, you can see all items that you own, including gears, upgrade modules, ammo, medical items, secret keys, cache, and other consumables. By clicking on the item, you can see the details of that item.  

You can choose to equip your gear by clicking the equip button. Equipped gear will be highlighted on the top of the inventory page. By clicking on gears, you can choose to install upgrade modules that will enhance certain values of that gear.  

To remove installed upgrade modules, simply click on the installed module. Better quality gear have more upgrade module slots than lower quality gear.  

## Items in your Inventory

Your cache in your inventory can be consumed to print out gear using the molecular printing function in City Centre.  

Medical items can be consumed in dungeons to regenerate health (since your character cannot automatically regenerate health in dungeons).  

Ammo can be used to perform special attacks and destructive attacks during combat.

Secret key fragments that you obtained in dungeon chests can be merged into a secret key by brute-force in the terminal, which can be found in the City Centre. Secret keys will grant you access to higher level enemy spawns and dungeons.  

Other consumables, for example Hash Processors and AI Cores can be used to perform AFK tasks.

## Functions in your Inventory

By clicking the icons above your inventory list, you can filter out specific inventory. You will have 50 space, equipping gears with extra pocket status will give you more inventory space. To get rid of gears and upgrade modules, you can click on the **scrap** button. Every item scrapped will give you a tech scrap. To get rid of other items, you can click on the **destroy** button. Destroyed items will not give you anything in return so be cautious when performing this action.  

## Item Inbox

Items that other players send will be automatically placed in your item inbox and will move to your main inventory when you have enough space for these items. Items will be moved to the main inventory after you perform an in-game action if you have the space.

## Crafting

This tab in your inventory allows you to craft three different types of items: medical, ammo, and material. Medical crafting uses medical tech parts. Ammo crafting uses both ammo tech parts and military ammo tech parts. Material crafting uses hash processor and turns them into ai cores. As you level up the relevant skills (medical science, ammo crafting, and mining) you will open new recipes and be more proficient, allowing you to craft more and better items.
