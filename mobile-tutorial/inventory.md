## Inventory

You can access your inventory by clicking the option at the bottom menu bar. In your inventory, you can see all items that you own, including gears, upgrade modules, ammo, medical items, secret keys, cache, and other consumables. By clicking on the item, you can see the details of that item.  

You can choose to equip your gear by clicking the equip button. Equipped gear will be highlighted on the top of the inventory page. By clicking on gears, you can choose to install upgrade modules that will enhance certain values of that gear.  

To remove installed upgrade modules, simply click on the installed module. Better quality gear have more upgrade module slots than lower quality gear.  

## Items in your Inventory

Your cache in your inventory can be consumed to print out gear using the Molecular 3D Printer in the City Centre.  

Medical items can be consumed in dungeons to regenerate health (since your character cannot automatically regenerate health in dungeons).  

Ammo can be used to perform special attacks and destructive attacks during combat.

Locked containers (âœ§) can be found in dungeons and can be unlocked using Tech Scraps.  
These can be unlocked only at Terminal, in the main HUB.  
Depending on the quality of the locked container the ammount if Tech Scrap needed for unlocking it, can be smaller or greater, starting from 32 Tech Scraps.  

Secret key fragments that you obtained in special dungeon chests (a crate with key in it) can be merged into a secret key by brute-forcing it at the Terminal. Secret keys will grant you access to higher level enemy areas and dungeons.  

Other consumables, for example Hash Processors and AI Cores can be used to perform AFK tasks.

## Functions in your Inventory

By clicking the icons above your inventory list, you can filter out specific items. You will have 50 empty slots, equipping gears with extra **pocket stat** will give you more inventory space. To get rid of gears and upgrade modules, you can click on the item itself and then on the **SCRAP** button. Alternatively, you can hold click on one item, check-mark every item that you want to scrap and then press the **SCRAP** button that's above the item list.  Every item scrapped will give you a Tech Scrap. To get rid of other items that are not scrapable, you can click on the **DESTROY** button. Destroyed items will not give you anything in return so be cautious when performing this action.  

## Item Inbox

Items that other players send will be automatically placed in your item inbox and once you have enough space, they will be moved automatically to your inventory.  

## Crafting

This tab in your inventory allows you to craft different types of items: medical, ammo, Hash Processors and Ai Cores.  

Medical crafting uses medical tech parts.  

Ammo can use either Ammunition tech parts (Energy Cells) or Military ammunition tech parts (Anti Matter Charge).

Hash Processors uses Military ammunition tech parts, Medical tech parts and Tech Scraps.  

Ai Cores uses Hash Processors and Tech Scraps.  

As you level up the relevant skills (medical science, ammo crafting, and mining) you will open new recipes and be more proficient, allowing you to craft more and better items.
