## Types of levels

### Player Level

This is where all your other levels will be capped at. You can increase your player level by fighting in dungeons, fighting enemies and using Experience Memories. For the highest efficiency you want to keep all your levels in-line with your player level (This is recommended).

### Printing Rank

Printing level determines the level of the equipment you will print. Your printing level can never go higher than your player level. You can level your printing rank by printing equipment, either by Reverse Engineering Tech Scraps or Working at a Printing Factory (These are all AFK jobs) at the Job Hub. 

### Medical Science
Crafting medical items or intiating a job at the Job Hub will give you medical crafting experience. You will need these levels to craft better heal items.

### Ammo Crafting

Crafting ammo or initiating a job at the Job Hub will give you ammo crafting experience. Its useful to craft more ammos with lesser materials.

### Scavenge Skill

To start Scavenging, you must start scavenging from the lower levels areas (Flori Station, Grandiose Parking Lot 1 - 4) up to the higher ones. 

Higher scavenge level will allow you to scavenge for (ammunition, military ammunition and medical) tech parts in higher level locations, which will grant you better rewards. You gain scavenge experience by scavenging.

### Mining Skill

Mining can be done only with 'Hash Processors' that drops from both normal and challenge dungeons.

Higher mining level can earn you more BTC per 15 minutes of afk mining, that being the minimum duration at which you can start mining. You can get mining experience by completing the mining job. With higher mining levels, you can craft AI cores more efficiently.
