# Keys
When completing a normal dungeon, in the prize room you will find a dungeon key. If you take three unique keys to the terminal in the city centre you can merge them to open the next area. Which will include a new list of leveled enemies and dungeons to explore.

This is the main progression of the game and dungeons will continue to level with you. However if your player level is 13 or more levels below the dungeons recommended level you won't be able to join. So be sure to use the challenge dungeons to up your player level.
