## Secret Keys
Leveling areas of the game are called 'Stations'. Each Station has 3 other mini-areas and each of them have a normal and a challenge dungeon. When completing a normal dungeon, in the prize room you will find a key fragment. Once you have all 3 fragments you can craft a Secret Key at the Terminal, in the Shangri-La City Center (main HUB area of the game). Each Secret Key will grand you acess to a new Station and a new list of leveled enemies and dungeons to explore.  

Additional key fragments, after the main key has been crafted, can be either discarded (in a dungeon) or destroyed (from inventory).

Key fragments cannot be send to other people and they can't be sold on Player Market.

This is the main progression of the game and dungeons will continue to level with you. However if your player level is 13 levels (or more) below the dungeons recommended level you won't be able to join. If you are 13 levels above the recommended dungeon level, once inside the dungeon, you won't be able to interact with anything, including doors, quest givers or loot. So be sure to go to the challenge dungeons to level up your player level.
