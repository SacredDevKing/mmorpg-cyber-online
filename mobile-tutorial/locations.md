![3D Molecular Printer](/resources/mobile-tutorial/Molecular3DPrinter.png)  
In the City Center, you can find the Molecular 3D Printer, which will be used to print out your equipment from various caches.  
It is located in Shangri La City Center.  

Clicking on it will bring you to the printing panel which lists all caches you have.  
It costs bitcoin to print, so make sure you have enough. All details including BTC cost and experience it will give will be listed on the cache printing panel.  
If you wish to print a cacha, all you need to do is to click on the cache you wish to print. If you have multiple caches of the same quality and type, it will bring up a dialog, asking how many you want to print.  

A good strategy here is to print all the trash items first, then the common, saving rare and legendary for later levels. The reason for this, is that printing the common and trash quality items first, will provide you with Tech Scraps, which will boost your Printing Level, can be used to craft other items and unlock locked containers.

If you want to sell something to the Weaponsmith, you will need to open your inventory, click on any item you wish to sell and choose the Sell option.
