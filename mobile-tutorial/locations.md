## Locations
You start off in Shangri La, in the City Center. To leave the City Center, you're going to want to get on the Subway. From there, you can explore the various regions by going to different subway stations.

Here are the various areas and some information about each one.

## Shangri La City Center
This is the main hub, or home, to which you will often return. This is where you will respawn when you die, and where you will come back to when you need to get ready for your next run. This is where the Molecular Printer, the Weaponsmith are.

**Shangri-La State Bank**
In addition to your inventory, each player also has access to the Shangri-La State Bank, which is located in the Central Hub (Shangri-La State City Center).
To start with, you have 6 item slots. You can choose to permanently expand slots by paying BTC per slot. Multiples of the same item can be stacked, so for example if you hit the 1k limit on an item, you can store overflowed items in the bank.
Depositing items will cost 100 BTC per slot. However taking items back out is free. Therefore it's a good idea to use it as storage for items you won't be using for a while like Legendary's and overflowed items.

## Commercial Area
At this location you can look for jobs (AFK tasks). You do not need to do anything during these tasks and it will be finished automatically after the timer runs out.
You can get printing experience, ammo/medical crafting experience, and BTC.
For details on every job you can take refer to the Commerical Area page in game.
For details regarding job related progression please refer to experience tutorial page.

## Player Market
At this location you can sell and purchase items from other players with BTC.

## Enemy Spawns
You can go explore the wilderness and combat enemies by taking transport. Each sector have multiple locations that cover a range of levels. Higher levels spawn stronger enemies with better rewards. Advanced sectors need keys to unlock. For more details on keys, refer to progression tutorial page.
