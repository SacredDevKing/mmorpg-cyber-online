## Combat

In every adventure location, you will see a list of Nearby Enemies, as well as two Dungeons which you can enter. The areas are separated by level groups, and when you complete all three normal dungeon levels you should have three keys which will be used to unlock the next area.  
  
Click on any of the listed enemies to enter combat. While inside a dungeon, clicking on the enemy, represented by an alien logo will draw you into combat with it.  
  
There are different options that you can choose during a combat.

## Primary Attack
Attack the enemy with your equipped primary weapon. No ammo consumed.

## Special Attack
Attack the enemy with your equipped special weapon. Consumes one Energy Cell for each shot.

## Destructive Attack
Attack the enemy with your equipped destructive weapon. Consumes one Antimatter charge.

## Use Item
This option is exclusively for dungeons. You will need to bind the item in the Inventory interface to use them, and only medical items can be binded. XP Memories are used to increase your Player XP.

## Escape
With this option you can try to escape from combat. The success rate of escaping combat outside a dungeon is always 100%. However if you are fighting inside a dungeon and try to escape, the chance will be based on your escape stats which is taken from your armour and upgrade stats. If you fail to escape, you will then be attacked by the enemy without dealing any damage.  
  
The combat screen will show you how much health and shield you and your opponent both have, as well as the amount of ammo you have left for each of your weapons and the approximate damage they can do.  

## Death

If you die, you won't lose any of your items. However you will lose 10% of your total BTC and Player XP. This means you might lose a level if you die too much.
