## Creating an Account

Currently you are able to use Google, Apple or any email account to register.
You will then be taken to a screen where you pick your username. Make sure to choose wisely as this is permanent and cannot be changed for now.

## Logging in

If you already have an account, fill in the respective blanks to sign in or by clicking on the Google/Apple sign in buttons.
