## Dungeons
When in a dungeon you can click 'Send invite to global chat' and a message will appear in chat. Anyone around your level can then join you and help out. You can also click the link in chat that appears to join other peoples dungeons. If the person that joinedâ€™s level is too high they can be there to cheer you on but not interact. When an enemy is killed with help from a friend, everyone who dealt 20% damage or more is given xp and a chance of a reward. 

## Gangs
Currently gangs are just a private area for a group of up to 10 friends to communicate but there are future plans for more to come of this.
