# Dungeon Co-op

Dungeons can be found in the 'Adventure' area underneath the list of enimies. When in a dungeon you can click 'Send invite to global chat' and a message will appear in chat. Anyone around your level can then join you and help out. You can also click the link in chat that appears to join other peoples dungeons. When an enemy is killed with help from a friend, everyone who dealt 20% damage or more is given xp and a chance of a reward. All crates are unique to each player. In order to join another player's Co-op dungeon, the players level cannot be 12 levels higher than the dungeon and 9 levels lower than the dungeon. 

# Gangs
Currently gangs are just a private area for a group of up to 10 friends to communicate but there are future plans for more to come of this.
