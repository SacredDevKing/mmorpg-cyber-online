- Added some preventive mesure to reduce the chance of unwanted deploying of global buff when another player has alraedy deployed one:
  - When deploying a buff with an active buff and the buff is has more then 19 minutes remaining, the deployment will fail forcefully, you may deploy again after 1 minute if thats what you wish (might still have extremly rare chance of two person clicked at the exact same millisecond result in server unable to prevent it)
  - When deploying a buff with an active buff and the buff has more then half of the time remaining, a popup confirmation will popup show up. (this only applies to buff that has duration of 20 minutes and for `Frontal Cortex Optimization Transmitter` and `Rare Synaptic Acceleration Transmitter` only when buff is fully stacked, and will not work if you are desync from server due to network connection issue)
