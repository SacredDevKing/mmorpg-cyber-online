## Locations
You start off in Shangri La, in the City Center. To leave the City Center, you're going to want to get on the Subway. Down at the bottom of the "file view" will be a function called goToShangriLaSubwayStation(). Clicking on this will "run" that function, taking you to the subway. From there, you can explore the various regions by going to different subway stations.

Here are the various areas and some information about each one.

## Shangri La City Center
This is the main hub, or home, to which you will often return. This is where you will respawn when you die, and where you will come back to when you need to get ready for your next run. This is where the Molecular Printer, the Weaponsmith are, and where you can train your printing skill and reverse engineer any tech scraps you have.

##Shangri-La State Bank
In addition to your inventory, each player also has access to the Shangri-La State Bank, which is located in the Central Hub (Shangri-La State City Center).
Currently you are restricted to 6 item slots. However multiples of the same item can be stacked, so for example if you hit the 1k limit on an item, you can store excess in the bank.
Depositing items will cost 100 BTC per slot. However taking items back out is free. Therefore it's a good idea to use it as storage for items you won't be using for a while like Legendary's and overflow.
