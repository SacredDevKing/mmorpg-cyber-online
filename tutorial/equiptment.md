## Equipment
You can equip gear that you own, as long as the gear level you wish to equip is not higher than your current player level. All equipment is divided into rarities:

 1. Trash (grey)
 2. Common (white)
 3. High Quality (green)
 4. Rare (yellow)
 5. Legendary (purplish pink)
 6. Epic (Red)

Higher rarities, will usually give a higher quality item. Higher level equipment will give better stats. Higher rarity equipment usually has more upgrade module slots.

## Upgrade Modules

You can install upgrade modules on your equipment, they must be your player level or lower. You can remove modules at any time you want by tapping on the installed module. All upgrade modules have rarity's the same as equipment. It's always best to check the quality and stats of any upgrade module as the rarity doesn't play as big a part. But a higher level upgrade will usually be better than a lower level one.
