## Co-op

Players can work with other players to clear dungeons when the host shares their dungeon invite to the chat. 
Multiple players can attack the same monster and the damage inflicted by players will show up in real time.

Upon defeating all of the monsters, loot is different for each individual player so crates cannot be stolen by other players!

In order to join another player's Co-op dungeon, players need to be +/- 10 gear score levels.
