## Dungeons
When in a dungeon you can click 'Send invite to global chat' and a message will appear in chat. Anyone around your level can then join you and help out. You can also click the link in chat that appears to join other peoples dungeons. If the person that joinedâ€™s level is too high they can be there to cheer you on but not interact. When an enemy is killed with help from a friend, everyone who dealt 20% damage or more is given xp and a chance of a reward. 

Upon defeating all of the monsters, loot is different for each individual player so crates cannot be stolen by other players!

In order to join another player's Co-op dungeon, players' level needs to be less than 12 levels higher than the dungeon and 9 levels lower than the dungeon. That is to say the level entrance requirement is:

`dungeon level - 10` < `player level` < `dungeon level + 12`

## Gangs
Currently gangs are just a private area for a group of up to 10 friends to communicate but there are future plans for more to come of this.
