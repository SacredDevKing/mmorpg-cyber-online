# Experience Is how you progress your characters abilities.

## There are five categories that you can gain experience in:
  - Level
  - Printing Rank
  - Medical Science
  - Ammo Crafting
  - Scavange Skill
  - Mining Skill

## Level:

  - This is your characters primary level, You can gain experience for your level by defeating enemies in combat, performing AFK tasks or by using memories.

  - This level determines the level cap of all the other categories, so focus on improving this level as your other skill get close   to even with your level. You improve the
  level of any of your other skill until your main level is higher than the skill you want to increase.
  Keep this in mind when planning out AFK tasks, crafting, or printing, as you may waste experience on a maxed skill.

## Printing Rank:

  - Printing level determines the level of the equipment you will print. For example, if you have a printing level of 10, you will only print lvl 10 equipment. 

### Things to note and related information:
  - Printing level can never go higher than your actual level. 
  - You can't equip items that are higher than your level.

### How to level up printing skills:
  1. Printing equipments(decent but not the most efficient) 
  2. Reverse Engineering in Job Hub (uses Tech Scraps but is efficient)
  3. Printing AFK Tasks in Job Hub (not efficient)

## Medical Science:
  - You can gain medical science experience by crafting healing items in the crafting tab.

## Ammo Crafting:
  - You can gain ammo crafting experience by going to the crafting tab and crafting ammunition for your special and destructive weapon.

## Scavange Skill:

  - Scavange skill allows you to perform AFK resource gathering in different areas.
  - Perform these tasks to gain scavange skill experience and unlock better areas to scavange.

## Mining Skill:

  - Mining skill allows you to mine hashes and create bitcoins.

## General Tips:
  - Level up your printing to the highest it can be (your main level) before printing the items you want to print.
  - Print trashes and commons first to level up your printing. You can scrap the unwanted equipment later for Tech Scraps.
