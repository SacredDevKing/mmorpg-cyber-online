Printing level:

Printing level determines the level of the equipment you will print. Meaning for example if you have a printing level of 10, you will print lvl 10 equipment. 

Things to note and related information:
Printing level can never go higher than your actual level. 
You can't equip items that are higher than your level 

How to level printing:
1. Printing equipment(decent but not the most efficient) 
2. Reverse Engineering in Job Hub(uses Tech Scrap but is very efficient)
3. Printing AFK Task in Job Hub(not efficient and not recommended)

General Tips:
Level up your printing to the highest it can be(your main level) before printing the items you want to print
Print trashes and commons first to level up your printing. You can scrap the unwanted equipment later for Tech Scrap
