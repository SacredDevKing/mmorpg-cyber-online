## Quests

Quests can be found on the Explorer tab, in the left-hand column. Here is where you are given specific tasks that will earn you extra experience points and bitcoin. There are a variety of different kinds of tasks available, such as printing equipment, killing enemies, and gaining experience or bitcoin.

<br />

Hovering over the individual quest will show you what you have to do to achieve it. For example, a Gain experience quest may want you to get 1000 experience points. You'll be able to see your total by hovering, and it may say something like ` 125 / 1000 (12%)`.

<br />

Once you have completed a quest, a `Claim` link will appear next to the quest. Click on that to get your reward, and be assigned a new quest.
