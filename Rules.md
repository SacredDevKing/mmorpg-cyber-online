#### Here at CCO, we hope to maintain a friendly community. In order for everyone to have fun and enjoy the game, please familiarise yourself with the rules. 

> If you feel someone is violating one of the rules and no moderators are around, take a screenshot and report it via direct messaging the moderators in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JREx8xz).
### Important Guideline
* It is strongly recommended to play with only one account per person, our system will flag alt accounts, preventing you from sending items between your accounts. *this can happen even if you only have one alt* (We will not help you move your items or unlock the account if the system flags you)
* Never ever use in-game chat (including email) to send any kind of sensitive/personal information, game chat is NOT encrypted and NOT secure. I do not bare any responsibility to protect your information you write in game chat. also moderators if needed can request to read the log for moderation purposes. 

### Game Rules
* The use of bots and scripts are prohibited
* No tool assistance
* No excessive alts
* Don't exploit bugs, report them instead
* Keep usernames family friendly
* Advertising (global chat/discord/bio/gang motto) of Selling/Buying account/items for IRL money (both directly or indirectly) is not allowed
* Tagging/mentioning people for fun or with no real purpose is not allowed, this is to prevent people from creating accounts just so they can tag them (doing so will also breach the "No exceesive alts" rule) 
* Any illegal activities will get you insta banned, including but not limited to harrassing underage person you met in game

### Chat Rules
* Chat is for everyone, no one is excluded unless you break these rules:
* Politic, Religion, COVID topic is not banned, BUT be friendly, respectful to others opinion and non-offensive otherwise is deem breach of rules
* Stay family friendly
