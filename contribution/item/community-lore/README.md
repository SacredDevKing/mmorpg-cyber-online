## How to create a lore for item
1. Find out the item internal id:
   open the game on your computer (please do contribution on your PC because that will make your life much easier)
   head over to the item details page of the item you want to contribute
   Look at the URL bar, you should see something like `https://cybercodeonline.com/item?itemId=AI_CORE`
   now you know `AI Core` internal id is `AI_CORE`, the id will ALWAYS be uppercase and underscore-case
2. Create/edit the lore file, for `AI Core`, the file name will be `AI_CORE.md` (case sensitive)
3. Click commit, and you are done, once it is approved, it will be updated to the game automatically

## Guildline
1. Please dont make overly long lore
2. Stay immersive and lore friendly
3. The file format is Markdown, you may use editor such as https://stackedit.io/app# to help you edit the files
