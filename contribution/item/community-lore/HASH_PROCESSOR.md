**\[WDYMIMNUB\]** Hello, shopkeeper, I am going to work and I want your fastest hash processors.  
**\[Shopkeeper\]** My hash processors are too fast for you, customer.  
**\[WDYMIMNUB\]** Shopkeeper, I tell you I am going to work, and I want only your fastest hash processors.  
**\[Shopkeeper\]** You can't handle my hash processors. They're too fast for you.  
**\[WDYMIMNUB\]** Shopkeeper, listen to me; I want only your fastest hash processors.  
**\[Shopkeeper\]** My fastest hash processors would kill you, customer. You cannot handle my hash processors.  
**\[WDYMIMNUB\]** Shopkeeper, enough of these games. I'm going to work and I need your fastest hash processors.  
**\[Shopkeeper\]** My fastest hash processors would kill you, customer. You can't handle my fastest hash processors. You'd better go to a shop that sells slower hash processors.  
**\[WDYMIMNUB\]** Shopkeeper, I'm telling you right now; I'm going to work and I need only your fastest hash processors.  
**\[Shopkeeper\]** You don't know what you ask, customer. My fastest hash processors will destroy a supercomputer, let alone a man. You need a shop that sells slower hash processors, because my hash processors are too fast.  
**\[WDYMIMNUB\]** Shopkeeper, I'm telling you I need your fastest hash processors. I'm going to work! I'm going to work and I need your fastest hash processors!  
**\[Shopkeeper\]** You can't handle my fastest hash processors! No one can! My fastest hash processors aren't fit for a supercomputer let alone a man.  
**\[WDYMIMNUB\]** Shopkeeper, what do I have to tell you to get your hash processors? Why won't you trust me with your fastest hash processors, shopkeeper? I need them if I'm to be successful in my work!  
**\[Shopkeeper\]** I can't give you my fastest hash processors because my fastest hash processors are only for the cleverest beings and you are of the dumbest.  
**\[WDYMIMNUB\]** Well then that's it, shopkeeper. I'll go elsewhere. I'll go elsewhere for my hash processors.  
**\[Shopkeeper\]** That's what you'd better do.  
**\[WDYMIMNUB\]** I'll go elsewhere for my hash processors and I'll never come back!  
**\[Shopkeeper\]** Good. You're not welcome here! My hash processors are only for the cleverest and you're clearly are not of the cleverest you're clearly the dumbest.  
**\[WDYMIMNUB\]** You've had your say, shopkeeper but I'll have mine. You're a rascal, you're a rascal with no respect for workers. No respect for anything... except your hash processors!  
**\[Shopkeeper\]** Why respect customers... when my hash processors can do anything that you can.
