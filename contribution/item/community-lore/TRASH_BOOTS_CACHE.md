**Trash Boots Cache**.

They say one man's trash is another man's treasureâ€¦ 

These boots are definitely NOT ideal. You see visible signs of wear and tear. It reeks of dead sewer rat, and you notice a large portion of the soles missing from one of the boots. Judging from the layers of dust and debris, you understand that these have been abandoned for a couple years.

However, it's better than nothing, right?...
