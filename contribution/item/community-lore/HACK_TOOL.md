The SL-Data Corporation is an all-encompassing company that provide inexpensive welfare to citizens of many major cities including Shangri-La.

Despite what it claims to serve and protect the city, its use of a taxing system, "Protocol" is a widely used system that utilize cerebral calculation power to both provide workpower for the company, and to accumulate power.

This insidious measure has been consistently challenged by "Breach", a collective system attack conducted by accumulating the rebellious and violent tendencies of the netrunners, criminals and vagrant and subliming them into indeciphable shards.

By constructing complete "Breachs" with shards, "Protocol" may be disrupted, giving chance for netrunner to relieve the burden of brainpower taxation, but the battle against SL-Data is neverending.
