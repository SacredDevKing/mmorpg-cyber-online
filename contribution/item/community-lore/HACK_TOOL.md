The SL-Data Corporation is an all-encompassing company that provides inexpensive welfare to citizens of many major cities including Shangri-La.

Despite its claims to serve and protect the city, its use of a taxing system, codenamed "Protocol", is a widespread trojanware that utilizes cerebral calculation power to both provide workpower for the company, and to accumulate wealth.

This insidious measure has been consistently challenged with a "Breach", a collective system attack conducted by accumulating the rebellious and violent tendencies of the netrunners, criminals, and vagrants and then subliming them into indecipherable shards.

By executing a successful "Breach" with shards, "Protocol" may be disrupted, giving netrunners a temporary chance to relieve everyone of the burden of brainpower taxation.  Join the fight with your own attempt at a Breach, as it seems the battle against SL-Data is never ending.
