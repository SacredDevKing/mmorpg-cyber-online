You revel in the cluster's ability to follow alongside you as you trudge through the filthy streets.  As a group of 1000 AI Cores, it should be monumentally heavy and large, but when the cores link together they create a small spacetime tear that keeps the majority of it's mass in a tiny singularity.  The cluster seems to be using some anti-gravity tech that only 1000 of them together are capable of.

You see cluster reaching a tendril over to tap into your cortex-jack when you suddenly feel happy and warm like you downed a full bottle of dreg and won at Sabacc.  It ...was your idea to buy these AI cores wasn't it?  Who cares.  With a cluster of them, you'll be rich enough in a few days it won't matter who's idea it was.
