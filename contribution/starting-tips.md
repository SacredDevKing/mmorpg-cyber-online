# Welcome! Here are some starting tips:

* Keep printing level same as player level.
* Wait till your average equipment is at level 8 (check your profile) or so to do the first dungeon.
* Trash & Common quality equipment (names in grey & white) are used mostly for increasing your printing level.
* There is a tutorial on profile screen (bottom right), it is advised for you to go check Equipment, Leveling, Combat and Dungeon.
* Lastly, you can always ask questions in the global chat and remember to check out our [discord server](https://discord.gg/JREx8xz).
