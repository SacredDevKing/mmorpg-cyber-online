# Welcome to CyberCode Online! 

### Here are some starting tips:

* To begin with, take the Hyper Train Central Station [Adventure] to the level 1-4 area and attack the bad guys.
* Read the Tutorial and FAQ to learn the game mechanics.
* Wait 'till your equipment level is at least 8 or so, to start your first dungeon.
* Pay attention to your Gear Level. If your stats are too low for your actual level then it may be time to print some new gear.
* Items you print will always be the level of you Printing Rank.
* Print and scrap trash equipment (grey) to increase your printing level.
* Read the Tutorial and FAQ to learn the game mechanics. 
* The Tutorial can be found on the Profile tab at the bottom right part of the screen.
* A good start in the Tutorial is the Equipment, Leveling, Combat and Dungeon pages.
* There is no pay to win, all purchases either affect everyone or are purely cosmetic.
* Lastly, you can always ask questions in the global chat and remember to check out our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JREx8xz).
