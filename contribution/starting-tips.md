# Welcome to CyberCode Online! 

### Here are some starting tips:

* To begin with, take the Hyper Train Central Station [Adventure] to the level 1-10 area and attack the bad guys
* Follow the quests to learn the game mechanics
* Wait till your equipment level is at least 8 or so to do the first dungeon
* Items you print will be the level of you Printing Rank
* Print and scrap trash equipment (grey) to increase your printing level
* There is a tutorial on the profile tab in the bottom right 
* A good start in the tutorial is the Equipment, Leveling, Combat and Dungeon pages
* There is no pay to win, all purchases either affect everyone or are cosmetic
* Lastly, you can always ask questions in the global chat and remember to check out our [discord server](https://discord.gg/JREx8xz)
