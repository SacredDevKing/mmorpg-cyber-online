# Donation
T' provide the best No Pay-t'-Win experience t' ye, 'tis necessary that all paid features are cosmetic such as profile images  
or global buffs that benefit everyone in-game :)

## Why be profile picture donation-only?
'cause 'tis an MMORPG game 'n **NAH a datin' app** (I know it can be confusin' sometimes ðŸ˜…), therefore a profile picture ain't a standard nor required feature. 

**Profile images are served as a token o' thanks fer the donators**

**Fun Fact: 99% o' the MMORPGs do nah 'ave a profile picture feature, even wit' a donation or thar P2W systemðŸ¤¯**

## Do I needs t' donate fer me whole life?
No, ye can scuttle the donation at any time easily via yer store.

## The highest tier be so expensive, ye greedy @$%#^#$!
The higher tiers are requested by kind players who would like t' donate more. 

Jus' like most other donation mechanisms, thar be **No upper limit** on how much a scallywag be allowed t' donate.

(if ye wish t' donate more than be available in the app, ye may message me directly ðŸ˜ƒ)

fer example: Patreon/Buy Me a black brew 'n most other donation services fer creators do nah 'ave an upper limit on how much a scallywag can choose t' donate,

but due t' Google Play '& Apple policies, I am nah allowed t' 'ave links t' external donation sites in the app,
so the only option fer me was t' 'ave tiers fer the common amount.

## Do Me needs t' donate?
No. I strongly suggest ye **Nah** donate if ye be nah comfortable wit' it.

Donation does nah provide any gameplay benefit; 'tis purely cosmetic.

So please don't donate unless ye wants t' support the game!
