## Gan's
Gan's are a great way t' join forces wit' yer mateys.  Hands gain the ability t' access gan' headquarters, dungeons, 'n chat. Gan's can be created 'n joined once ye're level 3. Creatin' a gan' costs 50,000BTC 'n then has a weekly upkeep fee o' resources 'n BTC. 

## Gan' HQ
The gan' headquarters show yer gan' level, necessary upkeep, amount o' hands, 'n control o'er Shangri-La.  It also has new AFK tasks 'n an automatic recycler.

Gan' level impacts how many hands can be in a gan'.  T' level up, collect gan' Exp wit' the AFK tasks 'Gather Gan' Resource' 'n 'Decrypt Memory Shard'.  Thar be a leaderboard fer gan's, ranked by level.

Thar's a weekly upkeep due fer all gan's. If the upkeep quota ain't met, the gan' will be automatically disbanded.  Upkeep amounts are based on the number o' hands the gan' has -- so the more hands thar are, the more resources 'n BitCoin are needed.  Minimize the amount o' inactive crewmates in yer gan' t' keep upkeep goals lower.

Occupation gives gan's control o'er different areas o' Shangri-La.  If a gan' be in the top two gan's on the Occupation Leaderboard, those hands 'ave access t' a task called 'Collect Protection Fees'.  Control be gained by performin' the 'Reinforce Occupation at Shangri-La' task, which consumes one gan' supply crate.  'tis recommended t' discuss wit' yer gan' whether ye wants t' gather occupation points or nah.

The automatic recycler will break down various items like med tech or caches into tech scrap. This can be an efficient way t' create tech scrap.  Each item that's bein' recycled has a different timer 'n tech scrap payout, so be sure t' consider the return on tech scrap 'n time. 

The final AFK task available t' gan' hands be 'Hack SL Data Fortress'.  This task uses Protocol Breach Shards t' make progress on the SL-Data Fortress Breach.  Total progress can be seen in the Quest tab.  When a Breach has been completed, a global buff will go into effect.

## Gan' Dungeons
Gan' dungeon consumes a Gan' Invasion Order Transmitter when bein' created.  Aft the dungeon has been created, anyone in the gan' can join, regardless o' thar level. Enemies are 4-5x stronger than regular enemies 'n give 2x the exp.  Bosses are guaranteed t' drop a Rare Locked Container, Rare equipment, 'n some Gan' Supply Crates.

As Gan' Leader, ye will 'ave 3 additional options when visitin' one o' yer gan' hands' profiles:
 - [KICK] - ye can kick the gan' hand from the gan'; 
 - [PERMISSIONS] - here ye can grant permissions t' the gan' hand:
   - Invite - it allows the gan' hand t' invite other crewmates t' the gan';
   - KickÂ  - it allows the gan' hand t' kick other gan' hands;
   - Manage - it allows the gan' hand t' add or scuttle other gan' hands' permissions.
 - [TRANSFER LEADERSHIP] - ye can set another gan' hand as the leader in case ye don't wants t' be the leader anymore or wants t' leave the gan'.

Also as the Leader, in the Gan' chat, if ye jab on the numbers o' crewmates in the gan' on the top right, ye will be able t' [DELETE GAN'] thar.
