## Chat

Thar are 3 types o' chat rooms in CyberCode Online currently:
- Global (or General Chat) - Where everyone can chat freely 'n interact wit' each oth'r.
- Gan' - Only th' hands o' yer gan' can chat 'n see th' messages sent in that channel. Ye can tag oth'r crewmate in th' gan' chat as well.
- Private Messages (Mail) - Where ye can privately chat wit' scallywags. Ye will also receive notifications as in a form o' Mail from th' System aft ye sent items t' someone or vice versa, when someone bought yer listings on th' Crewmate Market or when ye receive a Street Cred from someone.

In order t' mention (or tag) someone in th' Global chat, ye can use '@' 'n th' name o' th' user. As ye type thar name, a list will appear 'n ye can select th' desired name from that list.

Th' crewmate mentioned by ye will receive a notification that ye mentioned 'em.

Note: Ye can nah mention (tag) someone in th' private chat fer obvious reasons.
