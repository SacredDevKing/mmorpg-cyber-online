### Important Guideline
* 'tis strongly recommended t' play wit' only one account per person, as our system will Jolly Roger alt accounts, preventin' ye from sendin' items between yer accounts. *this can happen even if ye only 'ave one alt* (We shall nah help ye move yer items or unlock the account if the system flags ye.)
* Ne'er ever use in-game chat (includin' email) t' send any kind o' sensitive/personal information. Game chat ain't encrypted 'n NAH secure. CCO does nah bare any responsibility t' protect yer information ye write in chat. Bear in mind that moderators 'ave access t' the chat log fer moderation purposes.
