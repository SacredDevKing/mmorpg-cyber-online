As wit' all other paid items, time skips apply t' everyone on th' server. Howe'er, since they skip time immediately, only players who 'ave started AFK tasks afore th' button be pressed will receive th' benefit. Often it can be helpful t' coordinate in global chat so scallywags are ready t' tag along.

Th' benefit be also applied t' all AFK players one-by-one, so it may take 1 ~ 3 minutes fer th' effects t' apply fer everyone. Most regular skippers will recommend waitin' around 1 minute aft th' skip button becomes available again, 'n purchasin' 30-minute skips be th' most popular choice when boosts are also runnin'.
