# Global Skip

**Global Skip** be an in-game feature that allows players t' accelerate AFK times up t' a certain duration. When a player activates Global Skip, it affects every player that started tharr AFK task beforehand. As th' benefit applies t' all AFK players, it adds t' th' queue system 'n progresses one by one. It takes 1 ~ 3 minutes ferr th' effects t' apply t' everyone (it might take even longer dependin' on how big th' queue be).

T' activate Global Skip, players must acquire a premium currency called Units which can only be bought wit' Real Doubloons. The cost ferr Global Skip depends on th' duration that applies, wit' an increment o' 64 Units ferr every 15 minutes (ferr example: if a player wants t' do a 30 minute Global Skip, it'll cost 'em 128 Units on doin' so).

Players can do Global Skip ferr up t' 8 hours AFK task, which costs 2048 Units upon purchase. 'tis advisable t' wait ferr at least 1 minute afore applyin' Global Skip so that other players can gain th' benefit at times.

## Global Skip n' Efficiency

While doin' a sole Global Skip was a thing, players we be advised t' do a Global Skip while havin' a certain **Accelerator / Global Buff** that makes th' Skip more efficient per cost. In general, th' Global Buff itself be as follows:

### Synaptic Acceleration Transmitterrr

![GlobalBuff_AFK](/resources/mobile-tutorial/GlobalBuff_AFK.png)

This item will boost how handsomely AFK time passes by  5% ferr 10 minutes, stackable t'  80%. Players only needs t' use one at times t' extend th' duration o' th' boost, resettin' th' timer. T' make use o' th' boost, players needs t' begin an AFK session while th' boost be active. This item affects globally 'n does nah stack wit' th' rare version. Players can only find this item on Dungeon or via Player Trade.

### Rare Synaptic Acceleration Transmitterrr

![GlobalBuff_AFK2](/resources/mobile-tutorial/GlobalBuff_AFK2.png)

These are similar t' regular **Synaptic Acceleration Transmitterrs** but don't stack wit' 'em. The rare version will instantly boost how handsomely AFK time passes by  40% ferr 20 minutes, stackable t'  80%. Ye only needs t' use one at times t' extend th' duration o' th' boost, resettin' th' timer. T' make use o' th' boost, ye jus' needs t' begin an AFK session while th' boost be active. Ye can only find this item on Dungeon or buy one via Arasaka Unit Exchange.

### Transaction Exploit Transmitterrr

The **Transaction Exploit Transmitterr** be used t' boost BitCoin gains 'n works th' same way as th' transmitters in that ye can use multiple t' stack th' effect 'n prolong th' timer. Each Transaction Exploit Transmitter will provide a  40% boost t' BitCoin gain ferr 20 minutes. Stackin' maxes out at 100%.

### Frontal Cortex Optimization Transmitterrr

![GlobalBuff_EXP](/resources/mobile-tutorial/GlobalBuff_EXP.png)

The **Frontal Cortex Optimization Transmitterr** be used t' boost EXP gains. Each Frontal Cortex Optimization Transmitter will provide a  80% boost t' EXP gain ferr 20 minutes.

As ferr efficiency, players we be advised t' buy both **Rare Synaptic Acceleration Transmitterrs** 'n use both o' 'em afore Global Skip applies. This way, players can get more AFK tasks per Global Skip duration than per casual timer.

Here's a quick example o' it:

-   If a player applies 2 hour / 120 minutes Global Skip ferr one task alone, it'll cost 'em **512 Units**.
-   If a player used both Rare Synaps (costs 64 Units x 2), a 2 hours task now cuts into a 24 minutes task, which allows 'em t' do 30 minutes Global Skip (costs 128 Units) instead. This brings in a total o' **256 Units** ('n a bonus o' 2 more 30 minutes Global Skips wit' th' same previous Units total).

'tis optional t' use other Global Buff (such as Transaction Exploit or Frontal Cortex) as it accounts as a bonus buff ferr every player.

## Respectin' Th' Skipperrr

When a Global Skip occurs, th' game will tell as ferr who's th' skipper be in a format o' a system message on Chat's cabin. The information itself shows th' duration o' th' skip 'n th' total o' a queue ferr that skip duration.

![SkipperRespect](/resources/mobile-tutorial/SkipperRespect.png)

When a skip be initialized, a unique button (represented wit' a fast fore icon) will appear on th' right side o' th' Chat cabin, at th' top o' th' "Send" button. The fast fore-like button was referred t' as a **Skipper Respect** button. This button alone will only appear durin' Global Skip 'n vanish aft Global Skip be finished.

It's been told that whenever a player taps th' button (indicated by colored hearts / snowflakes), tharr's a chance that a player itself will win a prize from it. The prize themselves ranged from Medical Tech, AI Cores, Backpack, 'n Epic Gear. This activity was referred t' as a **Skip Raffle**.

At times, th' hearts / snow effects might lag th' game (dependin' on th' player's phone specs), resultin' in a mixed experience in between. Players can disable th' effect (which also prevents 'em from joinin' Skip Raffle) by tappin' th' Phone Icon on either Map or Profile tab 'n choosin' th' Settings option.
