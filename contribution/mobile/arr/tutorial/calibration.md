# Calibration
![CalibrationStation](/resources/mobile-tutorial/CalibrationStation.png)

**Calibration** be an action where players upgrade thar gearr t' a certain point o' improvement, wit' th' purpose o' gearr longevity 'n usability on a higher level later on. Calibratin' a gearr does nah increase its level, yet it increases its base stats up t' a certain tier o' calibration.

'tis advisable t' do start Calibration around level 50 ('n above) as th' lower level will outgrow th' calibrated gearr smartly, makin' th' calibrated gearr useless on longer runs. 'tis also advisable t' calibrate gearr that's at least a Rare (up t' Epic) rarity as higher rarity provides more calibration tier t' improve.

T' do Calibration, player needs t' visit Calibration Station that can be found in Shangri-La City Centerrr.

## Performin' Calibration

Inside **Calibration Station**, player will be asked t' insert th' **Equipment Calibration Core** t' start th' process. Aft insertin' th' core, player needs t' wait ferr 30 minutes afore th' Station allows th' player calibrate th' gearr (**This waitin' process nah affected by any global buff / skips, includin' AFK Accelerators [Synaptic Acceleration Transmitter]**).

Aft 30 minutes, players are allowed t' calibrate any gearr (excludin' maxed Calibrated Gear) that's nah equipped onto th' slot. 

## Chance o' Destructi'e Failure

In process o' calibratin' th' gearr, thar's a chance that th' process will fail, resultin' in a gearr bein' destroyed. The percentage o' failure be indicated by th' red number on top o' th' selected gearr.

'tis advisable t' scuttle th' Upgrade Module that's attached t' th' gearr afore attemptin' t' calibrate, as both gearr 'n module will get destroyed in process o' fail.

In general, th' gearr capacity / fail percentage o' each tier as follows:
| Gear Capacity | Tier | Chance t' Fail |
|--|--|--|
| Trash | +1 | 2% |
| Trash | +2 | 5% |
| Trash | +3 | 10% |
| Common | +4 | 15% |
| High Quality | +5 | 50% |
| Rare | +6 | 100% |
| Legendary | +7 | 150% |
| Legendary | +8 | 200% |
| Epic | +9 | 400% |
| Epic | +10 | 666% |

## Override Th' Chance
Any  6 calibration 'n beyond be *impossible t' achieve* without th' use o' **Calibration Boost**. They reduce th' failure percentage 'n they stack / add wit' each other.

In general, th' calibration boost tier ('n where t' find 'em) as follows:
- **Calibration AI Shard (Common)** reduce th' chance o' failure by 5%; only ferr Personal Use; can be found on Rare Locked Container
- **Calibration AI Shard (Rare)** reduce th' chance o' failure by 10%; Global Buff; can only be bought on Arasaka Unit Exchange
- **Calibration AI Shard (Legendary)** reduce th' chance o' failure by 50%; Global Buff; can only be bought on Arasaka Unit Exchange
- **Calibration AI Shard (Epic)** reduce th' chance o' failure by 100%; Global Buff; can only be bought on Arasaka Unit Exchange 

Player can also negate th' destructive effect by activatin' **Calibration Safety Nano Bots** (which can be found on Mysterious Container / bought on Arasaka Unit Exchange) afore calibratin' th' gearrr.

Keep in mind that th' boosts **will only last ferr 5 min**. It's best t' be prepared afore boostin'.

##  Trade / Sell Calibrated Gearrr
