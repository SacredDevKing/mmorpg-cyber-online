## Equipment
Ye can equip th' gear that ye owns as long as th' gear level ye wish t' equip ain't higher than yer current player level.  
All equipment will be one o' th' followin' rarities:

  - Trash (Grey)
  - Common (White)
  - High Quality (Green)
  - Rare (Yellow)
  - Legendary (Fuchsia, Deep Pink)
  - Epic (Dark Red)

Higher rarities will 'ave better stats 'n more module upgrade slots, dependin' on th' piece o' equipment. 

ðŸ”¹ As a newbie, it's important t' craft 'n equip trash quality gear since it's th' cheapest one t' print.
ðŸ”¹ Startin' from level 5 up t' level 10, ye can start printin' common quality caches. 
ðŸ”¹ From level 10 t' 20, ye will 'ave enough BTC t' start usin' High Quality gear.
ðŸ”¹ From level 20 t' 40 - 50, ye can print 'n wear Rare Quality gear.
ðŸ”¹ 'n from level 40 - 50, ye can print 'n wear Legendary Quality gear. 
ðŸ”¹ From level 90 - 100 , if ye ever 'ave th' chance t' get or t' buy one or more, ye can print 'n wear Epic Quality gear, which be th' highest 'n rarest type o' gear in th' game. 

These are nah rules on how ye shall manage different types o' quality equipment but they be rather recommendations on wha' type o' equipment ye shall 'ave at different levels.


## Findin' Equipment

Ye can find equipment 'n equipment caches in th' dungeons or when fightin' individual enemies (street fights).  

Once ye be level 5, ye will be able t' use th' Player Market t' purchase different types o' equipment, craftin' materials 'n other items.

## Printin' Equipment

Caches can be used t' print equipment at yer current Printin' Rank at th' Molecular 3D Printer in th' City Center. 

Th' level o' th' printed gear will be th' same as yer Printin' Rank, so make sure t' keep yer Printin' Rank at th' same level as yer player level.

## Upgrade Modules

Ye can install upgrade modules in yer equipment. In order t' equip th' module, it's level can nah be higher than th' equipment's level.  
E.g.: ye can nah install a level 20 upgrade module in level 5 gloves.

Upgrade modules can be scuttled at any time.  
Scuttled upgrade modules will take space in yer in'entory so pay attention t' that.  
Make sure ye 'ave enough space in yer loot afore scuttlin' any upgrades.  

If yer in'entory be gettin' cluttered wit' upgrade modules ye can nah bear t' get rid o', remember ye can store unused modules in any unused equipment in yer in'entory.
Level rules still apply, 'n remember t' scuttle 'em afore gettin' rid o' th' equipment.

Scrappin' a piece o' equipment that 'ave an upgrade module installed in it, will also scuttle th' said module!
Ye will nah recover it!
