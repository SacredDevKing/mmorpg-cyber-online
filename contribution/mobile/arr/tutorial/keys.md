## Secret Keys
Levelin' areas o' the game are called 'Stations'. Each Station has 3 mini-areas, each wit' mobs within a certain level range 'n normal 'n challenge dungeons. Every dungeon has a boss cabin, wit' either lots o' tough mobs which are higher level or a super boss which has a lot o' hitpoints, potentially defeatin' players in one hit.

Aft defeatin' all o' the enemies in the boss cabin o' a challenge dungeon, ye will find a key fragment which be represented by a window icon in the cabin. Once ye 'ave all 3 fragments from one station, ye can craft a Secret Key at the Terminal, which be found at the Shangri-La City Center (main HUB area o' the game). Each Secret Key will grant ye access t' a new Station 'n a new list o' higher-level enemies 'n dungeons t' explore. 

Additional key fragments can either be discarded (when interactin' wit' the icon in the dungeon) or destroyed (from yer in'entory).

Key fragments can nah be sent t' other scallywags nor be sold on the Crewmate Market.

'tis the main progression mechanic o' the game 'n dungeons will continue t' increase in level 'n difficulty wit' ye. Howe'er, if yer player level be 10 levels below the dungeon's recommended level, ye won't be able t' join it. If ye be too many levels above a mob, ye also won't receive any loot rewards on defeatin' the enemy. If ye be 12 levels above the recommended dungeon level, ye won't be able t' interact wit' anythin', includin' doors, quest givers 'n loot.
