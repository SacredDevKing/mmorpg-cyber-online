## Gan's
Currently gan's are jus' a private chat area fer a group o' up t' 32 crewmate t' communicate, but thar are future plans fer features t' be added.

As Gan' Leader, ye will 'ave 3 additional options when visitin' one o' yer gan' hands' profiles:
 - [KICK] - ye can kick the gan' hand from the gan'; 
 - [PERMISSIONS] - here ye can grant permissions t' the gan' hand:
   - Invite - it allows the gan' hand t' invite other crewmates t' the gan';
   - KickÂ  - it allows the gan' hand t' kick other gan' hands;
   - Manage - it allows the gan' hand t' add or scuttle other gan' hands' permissions.
 - [TRANSFER LEADERSHIP] - ye can set another gan' hand as the leader in case ye don't wants t' be the leader anymore or wants t' leave the gan'.

Also as the Leader, in the Gan' chat, if ye jab on the numbers o' crewmates in the gan' on the top right, ye will be able t' [DELETE GAN'] thar.


## Friends
T' access yer matey list, jab on the floatin' menu 'n choose the 'person' icon.
Ye can add matey by goin' into a user's profile, scrollin' down 'n jabbin' 'Add t' Shipmate List'. Ye can do the same t' scuttle a crewmate by jabbin' the 'Scuttle From Heartie List' button.
Addin' someone t' yer matey list will nah require the other crewmate t' accept the request. They will simply be added t' yer mateys list.
Viewin' yer mateys list will allow ye t' see if they be online, idle or offline.
