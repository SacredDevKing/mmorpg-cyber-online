![EnemyGangGraph](/resources/mobile-tutorial/EnemyGangGraph.png)

All enemies 'ave a gang that it belongs t', as each area will 'ave a different gang _'dominant'_ in retrospect. These gangs will affect how players approach as the enemy gang will either benefit players or make the fight even harder.

In summary, enemy gangs name & trait as follows:
- **Animals:** Increased damage t' **Disruptor** players (up t' 10%)

- **Voodoo Boys**: Increased damage t' **Makeshift** players (up t' 10%)

- **Scavengers**: Increased damage t' **Lethal** players (up t' 10%)

One o' the few ways t' know which gangs are dominatin' the area be through **Nearby Enemies** or surfin' around **Dungeon**. By seein' thar gang name on the top o' its health bar, ye can notify who's who mighty handsomely. Players can still change thar gear in-fight stance if they reckon the enemies will benefit from its **Mark** spots.

## Equipment Mark

All gear / equipment (Except backpacks & modules) has a **Mark** that attach t' it, which has a different effect dependin' on thar enemy's influence.

In summary, marks name & trait as follows:

- **Lethal**: Increase damage t' **Animals** enemies (up t' 10%)

- **Disruptor**: Increase damage t' **Voodoo Boys** enemies (up t' 10%)

- **Makeshift**: Increase damage t' **Scavengers** enemies (up t' 10%)

Players can see the effects o' havin' a certain amount o' **Mark** by tappin' the yellow Mark text on Equipped section or from the Player's stats on **Profile** tab. As the graph suggested above, every Mark will affect both gangs in a good or bad sense o' ways.
