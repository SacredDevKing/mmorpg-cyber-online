## Inventory

You can access your inventory by clicking the option at the bottom menu bar. In your inventory, you can see all items that you own, including equipment, upgrade modules, ammo, medical items, secret keys, caches, and other consumables. By clicking on the item, you can see the details of that item.  

You can choose to equip gear by choosing the equip button. Equipped gear will be highlighted at the top of the inventory page. By clicking on gears, you can also choose to install upgrade modules that will enhance certain values of that item.

To remove installed upgrade modules, simply click on the installed module. Better quality equipment have more upgrade module slots.

## Items in your Inventory

Your caches in your inventory can be consumed to print gear using the Molecular 3D Printer in the City Center.  

Medical items can be consumed in dungeons to regenerate health (your character will not automatically regenerate health in dungeons as they would after normal battles in a train station).  

Ammo can be used to perform special attacks and destructive attacks during combat.

Locked containers (âœ§) can be found in dungeons and can be unlocked using Tech Scraps at the Terminal in the main HUB.  
Depending on the quality of the locked container, the amount of Tech Scrap needed for unlocking it may be greater; the required Tech Scraps start at 32. If you don't see the option for unlocking the container at the Terminal, it means you do not have enough Tech Scraps.

Secret key fragments that you obtained in special dungeon chests can be merged into a secret key by brute-forcing it at the Terminal. Secret keys will grant you access to higher level enemy areas and dungeons.  

Other consumables, such as Hash Processors and AI Cores, can be used to perform AFK tasks.

## Functions in your Inventory

By clicking the icons above your inventory list, you can filter out specific items. You will start with 50 empty slots; equipping gear with the **pocket** stat will give you more inventory space. To get rid of equipment and upgrade modules, you can click on the item itself and then on the **SCRAP** button. Alternatively, you can hold click on one item, select every item you want to scrap, then press the **SCRAP** button that will appear at the top left of the item list. Every item scrapped will give you Tech Scrap. To get rid of other items that are not scrappable, you can click on the **DESTROY** button. Destroyed items will not give you anything in return, so be cautious when performing this action.  

## Item Inbox

Items that other players send will be automatically placed in your item inbox. Once you have enough space in your inventory, they will be moved automatically to your inventory. There is sometimes a delay before this happens.

## Crafting

This tab in your inventory allows you to craft different types of items: medicine, ammo, Hash Processors and AI Cores.  

Medical crafting uses medical tech parts.  

Ammo crafting can use either ammunition tech parts (for Energy Cells) or military ammunition tech parts (for Anti Matter Charges).

Hash Processors use military ammunition tech parts, medical tech parts and Tech Scraps.  

AI Cores use Hash Processors and Tech Scraps.  

As you level up the relevant skills (medical science, ammo crafting, and mining), you will unlock new recipes and become more proficient, allowing you to craft more and better items.
