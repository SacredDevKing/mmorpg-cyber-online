# Social
In CyberCodeOnline, there are few ways of communicating with other players around the world, which ranged from social chatting onto personal messaging with other player.

## Chats
Chats consist of different channels, with a goal to socialize with each other. These were justified by having **Chat Quest** being activated after player speaks in chat for the first time.  

Explanation around Chat can be found on [Chat's Tutorial](https://cybercodeonline.com/markdown?path=tutorial%2Fchat.md)

## 公會
目前公會只是一個供最多 32 名公會成員私下聊天的地方。未來將為公會新增其他功能。

## 朋友
你可以點擊浮動選單的「好友列表」圖示造訪你的個人好友列表。
若你要新增好友，你可以造訪其他玩家的個人檔案頁面，向下滑動並點擊「加入好友清單」按鈕。你也可以在同樣頁面點擊「移除好友清單」按鈕以移除好友。
將其他玩家加入好友，並不需要事先取得該玩家的同意。他將直接被加入你的好友清單。
透過你的好友清單，你可以看到好友們是否正在線上、閒置、或者離線。

## Block Feature

Players are able to block other players when necessary. To do so, a player needs to click their Username (in chat) and pick **Block Option** that's below the Profile option. When a player gets blocked, the player who blocked them can't see their messages until they unblock them.

To unblock other players, a player needs to find **Block List** option, which can be found on Profile / Map > Phone Icon > All Apps > Block List. After that, the player chooses the player's username and click **Unblock** button that's on the right side of the blocked player's username.

After choosing out which player will be unblocked, a pop-up will be shown, to confirm player's action on unblocking the stated player. Clicking on **YES** button implies that the stated player will be unblocked and its chat can be seen again.

## 玩家交易
While there is no official feature to trade, **Sending Gift to Player** works in a way bridge out the way of trading in this game. To initialize a trade, both players arrange a deal via **Private Message** with a sense of trust on both sides. Once a deal is approved, both players trade their goods and thank each other when a deal is done.

If a player tries to scam others, it's recommended to report this behavior to in-game `Moderator` via Private Message rather than announce it in **Global Chat** to prevent misinformation or bad behavior by any means.
