There once was a time before people had such a unit of measurement. 
Back when people we so focused on scraping together the scrap they needed to survivde, they had no time to think about emotions or thinking.
"How stupid! 'Thinking about thinking,' and 'emotions!'" They may shout, afraid to face reality.
Reality is kevin. 

Kevin degrees are a unit of measurement which has grown strong in the days of the enhanced brain.
Afterall, an enhanced brain has enhanced emotions.
Kevin degrees cannot be measured by something as silly as "temperature" or "science."
Kevin degrees are felt in the heart and soul, not in "atoms".
Kevin degrees denote how cold or warm you *feel* it is. You don't need a thermometer to measure *feeling* warm.

Kevin degrees are calculated using the following steps:
1. Locate the nearest Kevin. This can be physical OR emotional distance.
2. Determine how warm this Kevin feels.
3. That is 1 Kevin degrees.
4. 0 degrees Kevin can be discovered by killing Kevin and waiting 8 hours (not recommended, but must be done once in everyone's life).
5. Base 2 degrees kevin on how happy and warm you would feel if two Kevins hugged you.
