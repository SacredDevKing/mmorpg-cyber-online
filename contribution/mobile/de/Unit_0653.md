##  Possible BTC Laundering Case 




```
Status: Unresolved 
```

A PDA was recently discovered in a local gang hideout with a BTC wallet containing a balance of 600,000 BTC. Based on the wallet program's features, and the lack of transaction history on blockchain, it is suspected that the BTC was recently acquired from a dead-drop of unregistered hash processors, an operation commonly conducted among Shangri-La City's most notorious gangs. The fact that an amount BTC like this has not been moved to cold storage is evidence of the speed of which the gang had escaped from this hideout.






Further Action: Forensic analysis of the wallet software's code will be conducted to determine transaction history and possible BTC tumbling activity, which may have occurred to mask the identity of the buyer.
