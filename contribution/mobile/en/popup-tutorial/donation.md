# Donation
To provide the best No Pay-to-Win experience to you, it is necessary that all paid features are cosmetic like profile images & chat frames, 
or global buffs that benefit everyone in-game :) 

## Why profile picture is donation-only?
Because this is an MMORPG game and **NOT a dating app** (I know it could be confusing sometimes ðŸ˜…), therefore profile picture is not a standard nor required feature. 

**Profile image is served as a token of thanks for the donators**

**Fun Fact: 99% of the MMORPGs do not have a profile picture feature, even with a donation or their P2W systemðŸ¤¯**

## Do I need to donate for my whole life?
No, you can cancel the donation at any time easily via your store.

## The highest tier is so expensive, you greedy @$%#^#$!
The higher tiers are requested by kind players who would like to donate more. 

Just like most other donation mechanisms, there is **No upper limit** on how much a person is allowed to donate. 

(if you wish to donator more then is available in the app, you may message me directly ðŸ˜ƒ)

for example: Patreon/Buy Me a coffee and most other donation services to creators does not have an upper limit on how a person could choose to donate

but due to Google Play & Apple policies, I am not allowed to have links to external donation sites in the app, 
so the only option for me was to have tiers for the common amount.

## Do I need to donate?
No. I strongly suggest you **Not** donate if you are not comfortable with it.

donation does not provide any gameplay benefit, it is purely cosmetic. 

So please don't donate unless you want to support the game!
