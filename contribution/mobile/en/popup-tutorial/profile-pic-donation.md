# Profile image customization
To provide the best No Pay-to-Win experience to you, it is necessary that all paid features are cosmetic like profile images & chat frames, 
or global buffs that benefits everyone in game :) 

## Why profile picture is donation-only?
Because this game is a MMORPG and **NOT a dating app** (I know it could be confusing sometimes ðŸ˜…), therefore profile picture is not standard nor required feature. 

**Profile image is served as a token of thanks for the donators**

**Fun Fact: 99% of the MMORPG does not have profile picture feature, even with donation or their P2W systemðŸ¤¯**

## Do I need to donate for my whole life?
No, you can cancel the donation at any time easily via your store.

## The highest tier is so expensive, you greedy @$%#^#$!
The higher tiers are request by kind players who would like to donate more. 

Just like most other donation mechanism there is *No upper limit* on how much one are allowed donate.

for expamle: Patreon/Buy Me a coffee and most other donation service to creators does not have upper limit on how much one could choose to donate

but due to Google Play & Apple policies I am not allowed to have links to external donation sites in the app, 
so the only option for me was to have tiers for the common amount.

## Do I need to donate?
No. I strongly suggest you to **Not** donate if you are not confortable with it.

donation does not provide any gameplay benefit, it is purely cosmetic
