## A Broken Toy

You notice something from the corner of your eye, you move towards it and after putting aside some rubble you grab it and suddenly a wave of nostalgia hits you.

> "Its a Maikon Kids Recorder robot, i used to own one of these as a kid!"

You say as you reminisce on the good times from your childhood and reflect on how you ended up scavenging this forsaken place.

Your smile turns to sadness as you remember all your friends that are now gone or dead to the wars and gang violence in this city.

You remember that these toys used to have hologram players that used to show what the robot saw while recording, it built memories based on what it recorded into a shard.

You found out that it still contained one shard in its slot, you press play.

> ***Interference and a low buzzing sound***

You think to yourself:

> "The hologram player is busted, wait i can hear something, at least the sound is working"

**PLAYING RECORDING//:holoentry01**

> **Soft spoken women:** "Happy Birthday Mi hija me and daddy love you so very much, i'm sorry we couldn't be there.. You know how your pa's job is alw ***---static---*** ng him work until late hours and mommy ***---static---***

> Oh almost forgo ***---static---*** res still leftovers from yesterday in the fridge, don't forget to eat!"

**END OF RECORDING**

You wish you went back to those days where everything was simple.

You take out the dust from the toy and leave it near the wall, hoping its owner would find it again.
