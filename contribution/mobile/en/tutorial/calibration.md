# Calibration
![CalibrationStation](/resources/mobile-tutorial/CalibrationStation.png)

**Calibration** is an action where players upgrade their gear to a certain point of improvement, with the purpose of gear longevity and usability on a higher level later on. Calibrating a gear does not increase its level, yet it increases its base stats up to a certain tier of calibration.

It is advisable to do start Calibration around level 50 (and above) as the lower level will outgrow the calibrated gear quickly, making the calibrated gear useless on longer runs. It is also advisable to calibrate gear that's at least a Rare (up to Epic) rarity as higher rarity provides more calibration tier to improve.

To do Calibration, player needs to visit Calibration Station that can be found in Shangri-La City Center.

## Performing Calibration

Inside **Calibration Station**, player will be asked to insert the **Equipment Calibration Core** to start the process. After inserting the core, player need to wait for 30 minutes before the Station allows the player calibrate the gear (**This waiting process not affected by any global buff / skips, including AFK Accelerators [Synaptic Acceleration Transmitter]**).

After 30 minutes, players are allowed to calibrate any gear (excluding maxed Calibrated Gear) that's not equipped onto the slot. 

## Chance of Destructive Failure

In process of calibrating the gear, there's a chance that the process will fail, resulting in a gear being destroyed. The percentage of failure is indicated by the red number on top of the selected gear.

It is advisable to remove the Upgrade Module that's attached to the gear before attempting to calibrate, as both gear and module will get destroyed in process of fail.

In general, the gear capacity / fail percentage of each tier as follows:
| Gear Capacity | Tier | Chance to Fail |
|--|--|--|
| Trash | +1 | 2% |
| Trash | +2 | 5% |
| Trash | +3 | 10% |
| Common | +4 | 15% |
| High Quality | +5 | 50% |
| Rare | +6 | 100% |
| Legendary | +7 | 150% |
| Legendary | +8 | 200% |
| Epic | +9 | 400% |
| Epic | +10 | 666% |

## Override The Chance
Any +6 calibration and beyond is *impossible to achieve* without the use of **Calibration Boost**. They reduce the failure percentage and they stack / add with each other.

In general, the calibration boost tier (and where to find them) as follows:
- **Calibration AI Shard (Common)** reduce the chance of failure by 5%; only for Personal Use; can be found on Rare Locked Container
- **Calibration AI Shard (Rare)** reduce the chance of failure by 10%; Global Buff; can only be bought on Arasaka Unit Exchange
- **Calibration AI Shard (Legendary)** reduce the chance of failure by 50%; Global Buff; can only be bought on Arasaka Unit Exchange
- **Calibration AI Shard (Epic)** reduce the chance of failure by 100%; Global Buff; can only be bought on Arasaka Unit Exchange 

Player can also negate the destructive effect by activating **Calibration Safety Nano Bots** (which can be found on Mysterious Container / bought on Arasaka Unit Exchange) before calibrating the gear.

Keep in mind that the boosts **will only last for 5 min**. It's best to be prepared before boosting.

##  Trade / Sell Calibrated Gear 
Players can't trade / sell their calibrated gear. To trade / sell related gear, player needs to **Reset** the calibrated gear by using **Factory Reset Shard** (that can be found on Scavenge or Market).
