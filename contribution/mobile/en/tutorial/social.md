# Social
In CyberCodeOnline, there are few ways of communicating with other players around the world, which ranged from social chatting onto personal messaging with other player.

## Chats
Chats consist of different channels, with a goal to socialize with each other. These were justified by having **Chat Quest** being activated after player speaks in chat for the first time.

## Gangs
Currently gangs are just a private chat area for a group of up to 32 (and more) friends to communicate, with a side of gang task and other gang exclusive feature. There are plans to add more gang related feature in the future.

## Adding Friends
To access your personal friends list, click on the floating menu and choose the **People**'s icon. You can add friends by going into a user's profile, scrolling down and clicking **Add to Friend List**. You can do the same to remove a friend by clicking the **Remove From Friend List** button.

Adding someone to your friends list will not require the other person to accept the request. They will simply be added to your friends list. Viewing your friends list will allow you to see if they are online, idle or offline.

## Player Trading
While there is no official feature to trade, **Sending Gift to Player** works in a way bridge out the way of trading in this game. To initialize a trade, both players arrange a deal via **Private Message** with a sense of trust on both sides. Once a deal is approved, both players trade their goods and thank each other when a deal is done.

If a player tries to scam others, it's recommended to report this behavior to in-game `Moderator` via Private Message rather than announce it in **Global Chat** to prevent misinformation or bad behavior by any means.
