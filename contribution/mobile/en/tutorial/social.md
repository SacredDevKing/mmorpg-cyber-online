## Gangs
Currently gangs are just a private chat area for a group of up to 32 friends to communicate, but there are future plans for features to be added.

As Gang Leader, you will have 3 additional options when visiting one of your gang members' profiles:
 - [KICK] - you can kick the gang member from the gang;
 - [PERMISSIONS] - here you can grant permissions to the gang member:
   - Invite - it allows the gang member to invite other players to the gang;
   - KickÂ  - it allows the gang member to kick other gang members;
   - Manage - it allows the gang member to add or remove other gang members' permissions.
 - [TRANSFER LEADERSHIP] - you can set another gang member as the leader in case you don't want to be the leader anymore or want to leave the gang.

Also as the Leader, in the Gang chat, if you click on the numbers of players in the gang on the top right, you will be able to [DELETE GANG] there.


## Friends
To access your personal friends list, click on the floating menu and choose the 'people' icon. 
You can add friends by going into a user's profile, scrolling down and clicking 'Add to Friend List'. You can do the same to remove a friend by clicking the 'Remove From Friend List' button.
Adding someone to your friends list will not require the other person to accept the request. They will simply be added to your friends list.
Viewing your friends list will allow you to see if they are online, idle or offline.
