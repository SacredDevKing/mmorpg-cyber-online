## Advanced / Gameplay Related

### What is the Gear Score?
**Gear Score** is the average level of the equipment you wear. This is calculated by averaging the 5 levels of your equipped gear, this includes: Primary or Special Weapon (it only accounts for the highest level between the two gear) and 4 Non-Weapon / Armor (Helmet, Upper Armor, Lower Armor, Boots) gears. 

It is recommended to continue upgrading your gear as you progress through the game as high level items have better inherent stats like health, damage and armor and will make Nearby Enemies and Dungeons much easier to survive on higher levels. The percentage bracket for modifiers are constant irregardless of item level. Utilise the Profile page and check your Stats to determine which modifiers you require when planning your build.

#### Why should I Care About Gear Score? 
Checking your Gear Score on your profile page can not only give you a quick idea whether you need to look to upgrade but it has two secret impacts directly tied into gameplay other than stats.
- The higher your gear score, the more XP you‚Äôll gain through the AFK XP Farm - Deploy Farm Bot, thus having an ‚ÄúAFK Set‚Äù will maximize your EXP gain.
- Dungeons will not allow you to obtain loot from chests or XP from enemies if your Gear Score is 10+ levels higher than the Dungeon Level itself.

### What is an AFK Set?
Many players have a swappable ‚ÄúAFK Set‚Äù; for this, only the gear score matters not the stats nor modifiers so Trash Caches can be printed to fill all 7 slots and bring your Gear Score back inline with your Character Level.  Before you rush off to start printing though; remember to make sure to check your level of Printing Rank on your Profile page as subsequent prints will only have the level equal to your current Printing Rank; if not, printing Weapon, Armor or Mod Caches will raise your Printing Rank.

### What is the Max Item / Stack?
You can carry up to 10000 items (same amount applies to Bank, Market, and Item Inbox) into your Inventory, excluding Gear & Upgrade Modules.

### What is the amount of Inventory Slot that we can acquired?
At the start, players will have the base of 50 Inventory Slot. Players can increase the amount of slot by equipping backpack (which can be acquired via Lee's Trading Post, Player Market, and Player Trade) and using gear or modules that has a **Pocket** stats. The max Inventory Slots are 178.

### What is Global Skip?
Explanation around Global / Time Skip can be found on [Time Skip's Tutorial](https://cybercodeonline.com/markdown?path=tutorial%2Fglobal_skip.md)

### What is Calibration?

### What is Pachinko?
**Pachinko** or **Pachinko's Plus Pro Max** is an AFK task that simulates the real-life game of Pachinko, where players put their in-game currency on a line for a chance to get a high-tier item (in this case, there's a chance of getting an **Epic Gear** from Pachinko) or merely a low-tier item (ranged from **Pain Away**, **Energy Cells**, and other materials). In order to "play" Pachinko, player must have at least 5,000 (for normal Pachinko) & 1,000,000 (for Pachinko's Plus Pro Max) Bitcoin in hand before starting the task. 

### Does the game support trading among players?
Yes, partially. You can send items to other players, but there isn't a system that forces the other person to give something in exchange. Most trades are conducted with trust. You can't gift BTC and key fragments to other players. Only Healing Items, Ammo, Materials, Hash Processors, AI Cores and other types of items.

### What should I do if my inventory is full?
You can either scrap, destroy or store items in the bank located in the City Center. Note that the fee for each item you deposit in the bank is 100 BTC. It doesn't cost anything to take the item back out. You can also temporarily increase your inventory capacity with the 'Pocket' stat found on equipment and upgrade modules.

### What does "Quality" on weapons and armor means?
The quality of the armor will contribute a lot on the stat it gives; the higher the quality, the better the stats.
Quality tiers go from Trash > Common > High Quality > Rare > Legendary > Epic. You cannot change the Quality of a weapon or armor.

### What does "Durability" on weapons and armor means?
*Durability is the ability of an equipment to remain functional, without requiring excessive maintenance or repair, when faced with the challenges of normal operation over it's designed lifetime (Wikipedia)*.  Durability only decreases when fighting Nearby Enemies.  Durability is not impacted when fighting in dungeons.

### How do I repair my equipment's durability?
As of current update, Durability will just be a mere numbers on your gear stats. It will never be decreased & the feature to **Repair** gear's durability were no longer exist.

### Do caches scale with my level? Should I keep them for later?
The caches you print scale with your Printing Rank. The gear that you obtain from them will always have the same level as your Printing Rank. Make sure to level your Printing Rank to your current player level to always receive the best equipment possible from printing.

It doesn't matter if you print your caches now or later, but it's recommended to keep your Legendary caches for level 50 / 60+. If you happen to find an Epic cache, hold onto it until level 100+ or sell it to other players.

Legendary and Epic caches are much more expensive to craft than Rare ones, but the items have much better stats.  Higher quality items can last you for a long time, and are often worth calibrating at the Calibration Station.

### Can I upgrade the stats of my weapons and armour?
Yes, you can upgrade your weapons at the Calibration Station found in your main map. Explanation around Calibration can be found on [Calibration's Tutorial](https://cybercodeonline.com/markdown?path=tutorial%2Fcalibration.md)

### Can I remove installed upgrade modules?
Yes. Click on the installed upgrade module to remove it from the equipment.

### Why is the equipment I print the wrong level?
Your printed gear will have the same level as the one from your 'Printing Rank'. It does not scale with player level.

### Will higher level enemies give more rewards?
Yes. Higher level enemies give you more BTC and experience after you defeat them.

### What are Locked Containers and how do I unlock them?
**Locked Containers (‚úß)** can be found and picked up from dungeons or by doing Scavenge Task. They can be unlocked using Tech Scraps at the Terminal in the main HUB, and contain various rewards ranging from Tech Scrap to Legendary gear. Tech scrap costs for opening the containers are 32 Tech Scrap for common containers, 64 for rare containers, and 128 for legendary ones. If you don't see the option for unlocking the container at the Terminal, it means you do not have enough Tech Scraps.

### What is Street Cred?
**Street Cred (Street Credit)** is a way to appreciate someone you like or who has helped you. They are similar to "Karma" points on Reddit. You can give 1 Street Cred per day. To give Street Cred, go to the person's profile, scroll down to 'Player Actions' and click on **Give Street Cred** option that's located under **Add to Friend List** button. Consider giving some Street Credit to the people that contributed to this game! You can view the list at Profile > Phone Icon > Leaderboard > Street Cred.

### What's That Heart / Snowflake Thing That Emits on Chat Room?
When a skip is initialized, a unique button (represented with a fast forward icon) will appear on the right side of the Chat room, at the top of the "Send" button. The fast forward-like button was referred to as a **Skipper Respect** button. This button alone will only appear during Global Skip and vanish after Global Skip is finished.

It's been told that whenever a player taps the button (indicated by colored hearts / snowflakes), there's a chance that a player itself will win a prize from it. The prize themselves ranged from Medical Tech, AI Cores, Backpack, and Epic Gear. This activity was referred to as a **Skip Raffle**.

### Can I change my name?
No, you can't change your name.  Your username is permanent for now. Mods / Devs have rights to change your username if the username contains bad / profanity / NSFW words in it.

### How do I tag someone? Can I search the usernames of other people?
You can tag and search for a user by typing @ in chat followed by their name (for example, type @DexterHuang). They will show up even if they are not online and they will receive a notification.

### Does the chat support emojis and kaomojis?
Yup ü§† ‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö. Please don't overuse or spam these, as this kind of practice is against the Chat Rules.

### Is there any customization in the game?
You can have a custom profile picture in your profile, a Title and a coloured chat border, if you decide to subscribe to one of the 5 Donation Tiers available. Elite Tier and higher, will have access to a bio on their profile and a barcode. These benefits are purely cosmetic.
