# Using the CCO Lore Wiki

- Make sure to check out the CCO Lore Wiki at https://cyberwi.red/wiki!
- You can reference the wiki to help you come up with ideas to add to notes.
- **Checking the Lore Wiki before you submit your note** helps ensure that any dates or events you mention make sense in the timeline.
- You can also freely add to the wiki to help flesh out the world of the game. For example:
    - Your note might mention a company by name, and you (and others) can use the wiki to contribute more in-depth information about the company's history, activities, etc. 
    - That way, notes can be short, but there is still a way for readers to find out more.
- For help with the Wiki, or if you want to be part of a group of lore writers who work together, send an [in-game message to Kimi Leta](https://cybercodeonline.com/player?playerName=Kimi%20Leta)
