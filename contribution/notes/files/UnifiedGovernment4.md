# The Dawn of a Unified Global Government
> (Part 4 of 6 WGO Series)

There has never been an executive, legislature, judiciary, military, or constitution with global jurisdiction. The United Nations was limited to a mostly advisory role to foster cooperation between existing national governments rather than exert authority over them. Until World War 3 happened causing 27% of the land of earth to be an uninhabitable nuclear wasteland. The remaining functional government bodies finally decided to cooperate to prevent such a catastrophe to happen again. Thus the World Governing Organization (WGO) was formed on 21st September 2066 to ensure cooperation, surveillance, and development of the whole world. Each country is still allowed to have a semi autonomous governing body, but every country would have to conform to WGO laws, regulations, and policies. The WGO also ensures that there is no barrier between "first world" and "developing countries" by ensuring equal technological growth and prosperity among all the nations.
