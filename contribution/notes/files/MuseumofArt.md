# New Exhibit in Shangri-La Museum of Modern Art : Celebrity's Torn Underwear 

> *You pick up a colorful pamphlet, it has an advertisement for a weird new museum exhibit*

Come and visit Shangri-La Museum of Modern Arts to witness a new unique and rare exhibit. The item in this exhibit was first sold at a public anonymous auction for a staggering 14 Million BitCoins. The previous owner who wished to be anonymous donated it so everyone can finally witness the greatness of this exhibit!

This artifact was a piece of costume worn by the super pop star Epic Dexter, well known for wearing unique, daring, and sometimes scantily clad outfits on stage and auctioning them for charity. Last year Epic Dexter did his first worldwide tour called Epic Dexter's Tour of Life, commemorating his 100th album and receiving his Golden Record award. On his concert in Shangri-La he accidentally slipped on stage while singing his top selling single "Cybernetic Potato" and ripped part of his costume in front of 500 million viewers which made this a priceless historical artifact. Come and see the "Epic Dexter's Compromised G-string of Life" exhibit with friends and family with your own eyes and gaze upon this artifact of Shangri-La's rich history!
