(Data Type - Operational Command)
(Data Structure - Text, Encrypted)

Operation is a failure. They've launched Project Fragment despite our best efforts to stop them. We were too late. Too many hiccups. Divert operational intents. Initiate Operation Gateway. I have authorized all personal to use force. This may be my last log, therefore I grant temporary command to Operator 32. I repeat Operation Gateway is a go. Use all force neceesary. I grant temporary command to Operator 32.

In the case where I do not return, Operator 32 shall take my place as the commanding officer, holding the title and commanding power of Operator 1.

Furthermore, I authorize Operation Broken Earth. All command post personal are authorized to engage full system parameters. Again, Operation Broken Earth is a go. I authorize use of Space Station Echo at full operating capacity.

Earth is gone. Make sure it doesn't spread...
