# BitCoin Adoption as the New Official Global Currency
> (Part 4 of 4 bitcoin series)

In 2071 the World Governing Organization (WGO) declared that BitCoin will be adopted as the primary global currency. The value of BitCoin is fixed globally removing any need for Foreign Exchange (Forex) currency conversions. This adoption ensures a secure currency that cannot tampered, manipulated, or devalued by any governing entity or individual. Historically there can only be 21 million BitCoins in circulation but the WGO decided that each BitCoin will be split into 10 billion pieces with each piece having the value of 1 US Dollar.
