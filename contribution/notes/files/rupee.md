>Closing the door behind you as you enter this new room, a pool of prismatic light lures
in your sense of wonderment. You walk towards the pool of light, trying to catch it.

>What you find is a pile of oddly shaped crystal. You take a look around. You wonder if someone left them here
on purpose. You pick one up and held it to what little light there was. Nothing spectular upon
first impression. In fact, not much of an impression at all. The only thing that were remarkable
about these crystals is the fact that they came in a multitude of color. Faded with age beside,
you can make out a few distinctive color: red, white, green, purple, even a blue one. They are
still shiny despite being left to the element for a long time. Setting aside the fact that they 
are a bit cracked and a tad dulled, they held their state pretty well, you remark.

>You leave the pile of crystal where it is, leaving them for the next person to appriciate their
timeworn, but ageless, beauty.
