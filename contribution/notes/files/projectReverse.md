The infection is spreading too rapidly. Our research team can't keep up with the variants the Nanobots are producing. They're attacking everything that comes near them. They seem to be trying to breach containment. I'm worried that the EMP fields won't be enough, so I have created a new containment system for them.

The storage unit consists of high frequency sound waves capable of tearing apart weakly bound atoms. I've added a vacuum chamber outside around the system to prevent any structural failures. If all else fails, I will activate the failsafe.

If worst comes to worst, I just hope they'll tell my wife that I love her.
