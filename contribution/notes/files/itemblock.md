>A metalic box. A weird box with a weird weight to it. You shake it. Clearly something is inside,
tumbling around. You take a good look at it with what dim light you could find. A once bright yellow
color has long faded to a more muted shade. The "?" symbol etched on the four sides of the box felt
smooth now, corroded by the rough ground and wind over a long period of time. You shook the box again,
this time with no echo tumbling inside. Out of curiosity, you punch the box. A puff of dust and musty
smell greets you rudely.

>You toss the box back on the ground, wheezing from the dust. You leave it there for someone else to
ponder over the engimatic nature of the box.
