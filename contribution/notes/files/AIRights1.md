# The Sentient AI Rights Movement

> 28th April 2077 - Shangri-La Daily News (Page 1 of 2)

A huge outcry of public demonstrations and riots spread throughout the streets of Shangri-La as people protest the government decision to enact a new law that removes basic human rights to sentient AI entities. The government made official the decision to add the newly developed  "Cerebral Accelerated Parametric Transaction Control Hashing Algorithm" more known as CAPTCHA™️ to every financial transaction process that uses BitCoin. This new law was approved by the government today to prevent all sentient AI from doing any financial transactions in fear of the superior processing and predictive abilities of sentient AI from influencing the stock market and commodity prices.
