# Ethical and Religious Concerns with Cybernetic Cerebral Enhancements
> (Part 4 of 8 aicore series)

In the year 2071 the World Government Organization (WGO) released a new law that requires every newborn baby to be implanted with a Cerebral Accelerator at birth, and all legal citizens of the United World also get an implant. This new law sparked a lot of controversy from human rights organizations and highly religious citizens. Human rights organizations argue that forcing people to get implanted is a violation of human rights. The WGO press conference addressed this issue stating that having everyone implanted would be crucial for improving every citizen's quality of life. Cerebral Accelerator implants are meant to benefit the users, and are provided at no cost by the WGO. Highly religious groups voice concern that improving, modifying, and going beyond the capabilities of the human brain given by God is blasphemy and tying to surpass Him. Because of all the controversy and civil unrest WGO finally altered the mandatory Cerebral Accelerator to be optional but with benefits. Those who opt to receive a Cerebral Accelerator will receive free healthcare, higher Universal Basic Income, access to cortex transfers in case the user's body suddenly is unable to keep the brain alive, and ability to use AICOREs to automate their lives.
