>You find a lone moldy wooden board in the middle of the room. It's not attached to anything,
not to a post, or a skeleton. You walk up to it and picked it up. Moss and mildew covered the
erroded board, with some faint writing "Looking to buy GF, 100000G". You are not sure what it 
meant, or what it could possibly be referencing. You look around the wooden board. You find
a cape with a symbol of what looks like a tree. You wonder why anyone would want to wear a cape
with a tree on it for any reason.

>You leave the wooden board and the cape where you found them. Maybe the next person can figure
out what connection these two objects has.
