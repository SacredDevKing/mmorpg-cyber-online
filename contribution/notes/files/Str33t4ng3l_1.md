**Blonde-haired woman:** Hey, did you hear about the str33t4ng3ls are
holding another charity event to raise money for the orphanage this
saturday?

**Woman with lipsticks:** Oh, ya. They is the third charity drive
they organized this month alone. This city has been blessed ever
since the str33t4ng3ls formally became an charity organization
and they have been all over the news. 

**Blonde-haired woman:** Maybe we should go and volunteer. Does't
hurt to give back to the community once in a while. I have a girl-
friend thats on the chair committee.

**Woman with lipsticks:** Definitely give them a call. I know my
knitting circle has been trying to volunteer at one of those 
events. The Str33t4ng3ls always get so many helping hands that they have to
turn people away. Who knew there were so many giving souls left
in this city.
