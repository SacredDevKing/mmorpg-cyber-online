> You find a half empty vial of water sitting in the middle of the room. You wonder if someone
got thirsty but not thirsty enough to drink the whole bottle. Upon closer inspection, the vial
is made of glass, scratched and cracked in a few places. You swoosh the liquid inside the vial
a bit. From what you can tell at least, looking at it in the dim light and with your naked eyeball,
the liquid is just a tad thicker than water. You take the glass stopper off of the vial and 
took a whiff. The strong smelling liquid, despite being old, burnt your nose. You thought about
touching it but thought twice about it. As if out of instinct, you chucked the whole concotion
against the wall, shattering the glass vial and emitting a brief but bright blue flame. You
failed to notice that there was a whole crate of this stuff, sitting in a dark corner.

>You attempt to sweep the broken glass off to the side, so the next person can inspect the
now slighlty charred wall without hurting themselves.
