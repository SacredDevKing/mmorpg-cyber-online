# BitCoin as The New Currency
> (Part 2 of 4 bitcoin series)

BitCoins were created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services, but the real-world value of the coins prior to it's official adoption in 2071 is extremely volatile. Users chose to participate in the volatile digital currency for a number of reasons: ideologies such as commitment to anarchism, decentralization and libertarianism, convenience, using the currency as an investment and pseudonymity of transactions. Increased use has led to a desire among governments for regulation in order to tax, facilitate legal use in trade and for other reasons until the World Governing Organization finally adopted it as official global currency.
