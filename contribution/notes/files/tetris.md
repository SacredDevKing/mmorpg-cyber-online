>A wooden board, with some wooden puzzle pieces. You find a wooden puzzle set left in the 
middle of nowhere. You wonder if someone was playing with it and left it behind in a 
hurry. You look at the pieces of the puzzle. One is shaped like the letter "L", another
piece is shaped the letter "t". In total, there are seven different puzzle pieces here.
The wooden puzzle board is divided up with faded white lines. It seems the objective of 
the game is to somehow fit the seven pieces perfectly on the board. You spend a few
mintures trying to figure out the puzzle before giving up.

>You leave the puzzle set on the ground, letting it entrap its next victim, dangling
the solution just out of reach.
