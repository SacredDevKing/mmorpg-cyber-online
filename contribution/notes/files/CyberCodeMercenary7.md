# Ideals of the Cyber Code Mercenary Group
> (part 7 of 12 cyber code mercenary series)

The people who get chosen to be come a Cyber Code Mercenary are very diverse, there are no limitations of race, age or even ethnicity. Cyber Code Mercenaries are chosen by the neural scan results that indicate the highest possible mental processing speed and resilience. Both are required for the brain to be compatible with the extreme acceleration rates used in the Military Grade Cortex Accelerators. Some of them are people who just randomly got chosen by their aptitude, some are ex elite military soldiers, some from the secret service, and some are even ex criminals. Those who have criminal records have a special AICORE installed that can detect any intent to do criminal activities and forcefully detach the conciousness of the host then sends it to a virtual correctional facility. One thing unites them all, the obscene amounts of wealth they would amass from their bounty payouts and monthly salary.
