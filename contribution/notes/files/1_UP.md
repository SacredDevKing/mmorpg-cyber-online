>Ducking around a rusty door, a patch of moldy plantation grabs hold of your nature 
curiosity. Before long, you were kneeling down next to it as if your legs has moved on their
own.

>A handful of dried mushroom. Very dried, to be specific. The top of these mushrooms are 
covered green with dots of whites. At least, it WAS green and white. Now its more grey and
the white is not even noticable. You take a closer look. You sniffed. Doesn't smell like 
anything. You squint closer. Is that a face? No, you assure yourself. You are just tired from
killing a room full of monsters. You are very tempted to swallow these whole. You shake your head.
In another life, maybe.

>You put the handful of mushroom back on the ground, kind of. You tuck them in a 
dark corner, just in case you change you mind about eating them.
