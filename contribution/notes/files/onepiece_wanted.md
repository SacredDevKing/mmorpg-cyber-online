>You notice something stuck to a wall. You walk closer and discover a bunch of poster 
stuck to the wall. These poster features crudely draw portaits of a group of people,
each with their own poster title "WANTED". A man with messy hair and smoking a cigrette.
Another man with short, almost buzzcut hair and a scar on his face. A mild looking girl
with a sweet smile. A mischievous boy with a big grin and a straw hat. A bear with....
antlers? You had to look twice. You arent sure what you are seeing. Surely if they were
wanted criminals the SLPD would have already found them. 

>You leave the posters alone on the wall. Maybe the next person that find these will 
have a better idea where these people on the posters can be found.
