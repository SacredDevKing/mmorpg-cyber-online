"A brief lesson on the history of Cybernetics, Bionics, and Implants."

"Part 1
In the year 2055 the company Maikon began inventing implanted technology for the military to improve soldier effectiveness in the field. The tests proved so effective by 2060 military special forces and front line infantry were improved to run faster, hit harder, and have 3 times their normal stamina. When the WGO was formed in 2066 they instantly pushed for civilian use. By 2067 WGO approved facilities began popping up to dispense Maikon Implants to any who could afford them."
