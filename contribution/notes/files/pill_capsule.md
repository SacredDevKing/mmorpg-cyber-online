>A bunch of empty medicine capsules. One red, one blue, and one yellow, to be precise.
You are nothing sure what this bag of empty pill capsule is doing here, maybe someone 
dropped it in a hurry, after medicating themselve. You take a closer look at this capsules,
each the same but slightly different, almost as if they were made specifically to combat 
a certain kind of illness. You have a momentary thought about taking these with you, but
you thought better of it.

>You leave the empty pill capsules back on the ground, for someone else to marvel at their
bright color.
