> You find a small, unmarked black cube on the ground. Picking it up, you notice a thing break across the middle. You twist it and a voice recording plays

"We here at ***Distortion*** welcome you to the first rank of ***Distortion***. We look forward to working with you and wish you grand luck in the upcoming ***Distortion***. If you require any assistance, do not be afraid to locate us at the nearest ***Distortion***"

> The recording ends with a click and the box returns to it's original state. You return it to the ground and keep walking
