# Please read before submitting a new file

When you have finished your lore entry. Please run it through a spell checker. The easiest way to do this is to go to https://docs.new and paste the entry into a new document. It will then highlight any corrections.  
  
Always click the 'Preview' tab to make sure your entry looks correct. If you need a new line, then you need to add a double space to the end of your sentence / paragraph.  
  
If you would like to use more advanced formatting then please take a look at https://stackedit.io/app# which will make this easier.  

You do not need to make your lines fit to the screen manually. The page will do that itself, make sure that 'Soft Wrap' is selected in the top right option box.
