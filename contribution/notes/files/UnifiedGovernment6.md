# Shangri-La the Capital of the World
> (Part 6 of 6 WGO Series)

A couple years after the formation of the World Governing Organization (WGO) on 23rd June 2068, a global capital was finally chosen by the WGO. Shangri-La was the city that the WGO chose as their main headquarters and global trade hub. The reasoning for this choice being it's proximity to the biggest industrial block in the whole world, The New Republic of China. Ever since Shangri-La was chosen as the global capital, the city has experienced exponential and explosive economic and technological growth. The Shangri-La Commercial Area is well known to be the biggest trade hub in the whole world. Whatever item you seek, if it exists in the whole world, it is sold there. If the item does not exist, someone there will definitely be able to make it for you, for a price of course.
