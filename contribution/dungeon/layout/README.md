# How to add new room structure

1. Please add more entries under the 'rooms' list, and make sure the width and height is exactly the same (15x15)
2. You must not block the hallway area, there should be a gap in the middle of all four walls
3. You must keep the json formatting, use [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com) to test
4. Boss rooms are separate under the regular rooms
