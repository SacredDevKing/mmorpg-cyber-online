pics for lore stuff!
You may upload images that you need for dungeon lore to here.

If your file name has a space in it, you may need to change the space to %20 when you're adding the image to your lore note. For example, "my image.jpeg" would become "my%20image.jpeg":
```
![my image](/resources/lore/my%20image.jpeg)
```
Or, save yourself the hassle and just don't use spaces in your file names. :P

use "-" or "_" instead of spaces
