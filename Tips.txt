// Contains list of short tips used to be displayed in WEB version
// One tip per line :)


// Equipment, Items, Crafting, Shops
You can sell your items at the Market Street [Player Market].
You can repair all your damaged equipped gear at the Weapon Smith.
Your inventory has a storage limit; keep an eye on it or you will lose loot.
Dungeons are a great source for AI Cores and Hash Processors.
Scavenge to find components for crafting ammo and medicine.
The level of the items you print are the same as your Printing rank.
Detach Upgrade Modules when switching equipped gear to make them available for new gear.
Gear and Upgrade Modules with the "Expansion" modifier increase your inventory size!
Some medicines, such as Pain Away Spray, heal your teammates as well!
Equipment caches come in 6 rarities: Trash, Common, High Quality, Rare, Legendary and Epic.
BTC in this game isn't redeemable. It's just in-game currency. :'(
You can store excess Upgrade Modules in stored equipment to save inventory space.
Enemies too tough? Make sure that your printing rank is the same as your player rank and then print new equipment!
Curious about the cache that got? Go to the Molecular Printer and print it!
Always carry medical and ammo parts on you in case you need to make more supplies while in a dungeon.
Epic caches are extremely rare. Save them for when you're a higher level!
Low on BTC? Get some by crypto mining with some Hash Processors at the Commercial Area [Job Hub].
A higher Scavenge skill allows you to scavenge in higher level stations and get more and better loot!
Key Fragments, which are needed to access higher level areas, appear in both normal and challenge dungeons. Experience Memory shards, however, only appear in challenge dungeons.
While Anti Matter Charges aren't exactly rare but they aren't easy to come by either. One shouldn't use it at every single encounter. Save them for bosses or tough enemies.
Always check the market prices before putting something up for sale!.
Scrap your unused items to get Tech Scraps. These can be used to open locked containers and craft backpack items.
The Automatic Recycler, available at Gang Headquarters, yields more Tech Scrap per item than just scrapping an item through one's inventory.
If you need BTC, try selling unwanted items to the Weapon Smith.  The "Bargaining" stat helps with this.
Lost BTC when you flatlined?  Store items or BTC in the [Bank Of Arasaka].
Inventory getting full? Consider selling, scrapping, or banking some of your items.
If you find a item worthy, lock the item to prevent getting scrapped accidentally.
Running out of inventory space? visit [Lee's Trading Post] to craft a backpack or visit marketplace to buy one.
Have any low level rare items that you no longer use? Gift it to someone of lower levels, it would help them greatly!
The cost for upgrading slots in item vault increases exponentially! Upgrade only till what you need.


// Experience, Leveling
Skill levels cannot exceed your player level. If possible, don't waste time doing tasks when you're capped.
You can reverse engineer Tech Scraps at the [Job Hub] to gain printing XP.
"Trash" quality equipment is useful for getting tech scraps and printing XP.
Want to level up a skill and got some time to spare? Pick up an odd job in the Commercial area.
Enemies with the "Agile" modifier grant more XP.
Not leveling as fast as you'd like? Hit a dungeon! (You get 2x more XP)
The gear you get from the [Molecular Printer] is always based on your Printing level so make sure you always keep your Printing level as high as you can.
To keep the game fair and content-relevant, after a certain level, it's impossible to gain XP and loot from lower-leveled enemies or dungeons.
Fight enemies and dungeons above your level for more XP.
Calibrating gear makes it stronger, but calibrated gear cannot be gifted or sold.
Each level of calibration on gear adds more to the item than the last level, but is more likely to break the item as well.

// Combat, Enemies, Allies
HP goes back to full after each battle, unless you're in a dungeon.
You always attack first. Make good use of that advantage!
Using medicine counts as a free turn.
Shields regenerate after you defeat an enemy in the dungeon.
Craft medicine to be able to recover health between fights in dungeons.
Enemies with descriptors (e.g., Shielded, Mad, Angry, Tough, Agile) are tougher, but they give better rewards!
Keys are needed to access higher level stations. Search dungeons for their fragments!
Remember the CCO mantra: Hit, Heal, Hit. Don't risk losing XP and BTC to save on some meds.
Challenge dungeons always have a tough boss so don't forget to bring your friends with you when venturing in.
Dont get Flatlined! you'll lose some of your experience and 10% of your Bitcoins. Be careful!
You can't enter a dungeon that is 10 levels above your current one. It's for your own good.
Spamming buttons can lead to trouble, such as unintentional attacks or wasted meds. Keep calm and don't spam.
Your gang trait influcences the amount of damage you take and you deal to your enemy's gang.
