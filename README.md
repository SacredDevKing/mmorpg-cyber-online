*CyberCode Online is a **browser based MMORPG game** that is **disguised as VS Code***
*where you click functions and variables in the ever changing source code to navigate your character in a Cyber Punk inspired world*

It is meant to be played casually with many AFK leveling, Crafting, Procedural item/monster/dungeon generation mechanisms, and provides a platform for developers alike to chitchat and slack :)
